ABBEY E,2011,MAR GEOL,GEOMORPHOLOGY OF SUBMERGED REEFS ON THE SHELF EDGE OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF: THE INFLUENCE OF OSCILLATING PLEISTOCENE SEA-LEVELS,SUBMERGED REEFS; GEOMORPHOLOGY; SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; TERRACES; CONTINENTAL SHELF,"THE SUBMERGED REEFS ON CONTINENTAL MARGINS AND SURROUNDING OCEANIC ISLANDS ARE IMPORTANT ARCHIVES OF PAST CLIMATES, EUSTATIC SEA-LEVEL OSCILLATIONS AND OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES. AUSTRALIA'S NORTH EASTERN SUBMERGED SHELF EDGE REEFS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPLORED, BUT ALL STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED BY EITHER LOW-RESOLUTION SINGLE BEAM PROFILES OR BY THEIR LIMITED SPATIAL EXTENT. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUBMERGED SHELF EDGE REEFS, TERRACES AND RELATED FEATURES ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF (GBR), AND THE INFLUENCE OF PLEISTOCENE SEA-LEVEL OSCILLATIONS ON THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND GEOMORPHOLOGY. WE INVESTIGATED THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE (1400 KM(2)) 3D BATHYMETRY AND ACOUSTIC BACKSCATTER DATASET OF FOUR WIDELY-SPACED SITES LOCATED ACROSS CA. 650 KM ALONG THE SHELF EDGE AT RIBBON REEFS 1-5, NOGGIN PASS, VIPER REEF AND HYDROGRAPHERS PASSAGE. WE PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION AND SYSTEMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE SHELF EDGE FEATURES, AND CONSTRAIN THEIR SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND GEOMORPHOLOGIC VARIABILITY USING A WIDE RANGE OF QUANTITATIVE MORPHOMETRICS. FIFTEEN FEATURES ARE DEFINED, FOUR OF WHICH ARE THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY, INCLUDING TERRACES, PINNACLES, RIDGES AND CHANNELS. USING MODERN REEFS WITHIN THE GBR FOR COMPARISON, WE INTERPRET THESE AS FRINGING REEFS, PATCH AND BARRIER REEFS AND TIDAL CHANNELS RESPECTIVELY. THE INFLUENCE OF GROSS SHELF GEOMORPHOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHIC FACTORS DRIVING THE OBSERVED VARIABILITY WITHIN AND BETWEEN SITES IS DISCUSSED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MID-LATE PLEISTOCENE SEA-LEVEL OSCILLATIONS. WE OBSERVED TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF REEF GROWTH CHARACTERISED BY THE DEGREE OF DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WE INTERPRET AS ANALOGOUS TO JUVENILE AND MATURE MODERN REEFS OF THE GBR. JUVENILE REEFS ARE VERY COMMON AND OCCUR WITHIN EACH SITE AT DEPTHS OF LESS THAN 50 M TO GREATER THAN 100 M. THEY ARE DEFINED AS DISCONTINUOUS PEAKED BARRIER REEFS, PEAKED PATCH REEFS AND FRINGING REEFS. MATURE REEFS ARE LESS COMMON AND DEVELOP EXCLUSIVELY AT A DEPTH RANGE OF CA. 5070 M. THESE REEFS ARE DEFINED AS FLAT-TOPPED CONTINUOUS BARRIER AND DOUBLE BARRIER REEFS. THROUGH A COMPARISON WITH PUBLISHED MID-LATE PLEISTOCENE SEA-LEVEL OSCILLATIONS, WE NOTE THAT THE DEPTH RANGE OF MATURE REEFS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DEPTH OF REPEATED LOW-AMPLITUDE (< 20 M) EUSTATIC SEA-LEVEL OSCILLATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT OF THE RELATIVE TIME SPENT AT SEA-LEVEL. WE CONCLUDE THAT REPEATED LOW-AMPLITUDE SEA-LEVEL RISES PROVIDE THE MUCH-NEEDED ACCOMMODATION SPACE FOR VERTICAL ACCRETION THAT IS NOT PROVIDED DURING STILLSTANDS, WITHOUT INDUCING REEF DROWNING, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY HIGH-AMPLITUDE SEA-LEVEL RISE. LOW-AMPLITUDE SEA-LEVEL FALLS ARE ALSO LESS DETRIMENTAL THAN HIGH-AMPLITUDE FALLS, IN TERMS OF HABITAT COMPRESSION. TOGETHER, THE EFFECTS OF ENHANCED REEF ACCRETION AND LIMITED HABITAT COMPRESSION AT DEPTHS OF 50-70 M HAVE LEAD TO A CONCENTRATED NET GAIN IN VERTICAL RELIEF THAT IS NOT OBSERVED ELSEWHERE ON THE SHELF EDGE.",10.1016/j.margeo.2011.08.006,ABBEY E_2011_MAR GEOL,,,,,,,

MESOPHOTIC REEFS ARE RARELY, IF EVER, DESCRIBED FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD AND NOTHING IS KNOWN OF THEIR LONG-TERM RECORD ON GREAT BARRIER REEF (GBR). SEDIMENTOLOGICAL AND PALAEO-ECOLOGICAL ANALYSES COUPLED WITH 67 C-14 AMS AND U-TH RADIOMETRIC DATES FROM DREDGED CORAL, ALGAE AND BTYOZOAN SPECIMENS, RECOVERED FROM DEPTHS OF 45 TO 130 M, REVEAL TWO DISTINCT GENERATIONS OF FOSSIL MESOPHOTIC CORAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ON THE SUBMERGED SHELF EDGE REEFS OF THE GBR. THEY OCCURRED FROM 13 TO 10 KA AND 8 KA TO PRESENT. WE IDENTIFIED ELEVEN SEDIMENTARY FADES REPRESENTING BOTH AUTOCHTHONOUS (IN SITU) AND ALLOCHTHONOUS (DETRITAL) GENESIS, AND THEIR PALAEO-ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED BASED ON THEIR SEDIMENTOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, BIOLOGICAL ASSEMBLAGES, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF SIMILAR MODERN BIOTA WITHIN THE DREDGES. FACIES ON THE SHELF EDGE REPRESENT DEEP SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS, PRIMARILY FOREREEF SLOPE AND OPEN PLATFORM SETTINGS IN PALAEO-WATER DEPTHS OF 45-95 M. TWO CORAL-ALGAL ASSEMBLAGES AND ONE NON-CORAL ENCRUSTER ASSEMBLAGE WERE IDENTIFIED: 1) MASSIVE AND TABULAR CORALS INCLUDING PORITES, MONTIPORA AND FAVIIDS ASSOCIATED WITH LITHOPHYLLOIDS AND MINOR MASTOPHOROIDS, 2) PLATY AND ENCRUSTING CORALS INCLUDING PORITES, MONTIPORA AND PACHYSERIS ASSOCIATED WITH MELOBESIOIDS AND SPOROLITHON, AND 3) MELOBESIODS AND SPOROLITHON WITH ACERVULINIDS (FORAMINIFERA) AND BRYOZOANS. BASED ON THEIR MODEM OCCURRENCE ON THE GBR AND CORAL SEA AND MODEM SPECIMENS COLLECTED IN DREDGES, THESE ARE INTERPRETED AS REPRESENTING PALAEO-WATER DEPTHS OF <60 M, <80-100 M AND >100 M RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRST MESOPHOTIC GENERATION DEVELOPED AT MODERN DEPTHS OF 85-130 M FROM 13 TO 10.2 KA AND EXHIBIT A DEEPENING SUCCESSION OF <60 TO >100 M PALAEO-WATER DEPTH THROUGH TIME. THE SECOND GENERATION DEVELOPED AT DEPTHS OF 45-70 M ON THE SHELF EDGE FROM 7.8 KA TO PRESENT AND EXHIBIT STABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THROUGH TIME. THE APPARENT HIATUS THAT INTERRUPTED THE MESOPHOTIC CORAL COMMUNITIES COINCIDED WITH THE TIMING OF MODEM REEF INITIATION ON THE GBR AS WELL AS A WIDE-SPREAD FLUX OF SILICICLASTIC SEDIMENTS FROM THE SHELF TO THE BASIN. FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE OBSERVED THE RESPONSE OF MESOPHOTIC REEF COMMUNITIES TO MILLENNIAL SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL SEA-LEVEL RISE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.",10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.032,ABBEY E_2013_PALEOGEOGR PALEOCLIMATOL PALEOECOL,,,,,,,

THIS STUDY QUANTIFIED THE BENTHIC AND FISH COMMUNITIES OF TWO PROXIMATE, PREDOMINANTLY MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS (MCES), GLOMAR SHOAL AND RANKIN BANK, WHICH ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED FROM OTHER SIMILAR FEATURES IN THE REGION. GLOMAR SHOAL IS IDENTIFIED AS A KEY ECOLOGICAL FEATURE (KEF) IN THE NORTH WEST MARINE REGION OF AUSTRALIA. MULTIBEAM SURVEYS WERE PERFORMED TO CHARACTERISE THE SEAFLOOR AND TO DERIVE SECONDARY ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, USED TO EXPLAIN PATTERNS IN BENTHIC AND FISH COMMUNITIES. TOWED VIDEO SURVEYS QUANTIFIED BENTHIC COVER, AND STEREO BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER STATIONS WERE USED TO SURVEY FISH ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY. SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED IN DEPTHS OF SIMILAR TO 20-115 M. THE TWO MCES EXHIBITED DISTINCT COMMUNITIES RANKIN BANK CONSISTENTLY HAD HIGHER COVER (UP TO 30X) OF BENTHIC TAXA ACROSS DEPTHS AND FISH COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TWICE AS ABUNDANT AND 1.5X MORE DIVERSE THAN GLOMAR SHOAL. THE LOCATION OF THE MCES DEPTH AND RUGOSITY WERE MOST INFLUENTIAL IN STRUCTURING BENTHIC COMMUNITIES. PHOTOTROPHIC TAXA SPECIFICALLY MACROALGAE AND HARD CORALS HAD UP TO 22 X HIGHER COVER AT RANKIN BANK THAN AT GLOMAR SHOAL AND WERE DOMINANT TO 80 M (COMPARED TO 60 M AT GLOMAR SHOAL) PRESUMABLY DUE TO GREATER LIGHT PENETRATION (LOWER TURBIDITY) AND LOWER SAND COVER AT GREATER DEPTHS. THE 20\% CORAL COVER AT RANKIN BANK WAS COMPARABLE TO THAT REPORTED FOR SHALLOW REEFS. THE COVER OF SAND HARD CORALS AND SPONGES INFLUENCED FISH COMMUNITIES WITH HIGHER ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF FISH ASSOCIATED WITH SHALLOW HARD CORAL HABITATS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TWO MCES WERE UNIQUE WITHIN THE LOCAL CONTEXT AND WHEN COUPLED WITH THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL ISOLATION AND BIODIVERSITY PRESENTS COMPELLING SUPPORT FOR THE ADDITIONAL RECOGNITION OF RANKIN BANK AS A KEF.""",10.1007/s00338-017-1655-9,ABDUL WAHAB MA_2018_CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,

THIS STUDY QUANTIFIED THE BIODIVERSITY OF INVERTEBRATES ACROSS THE PHYLA ARTHROPODA, ECHINODERMATA, MOLLUSCA AND PORIFERA FROM 132 SAMPLING STATIONS ALONG THE COAST OF THE NINGALOO MARINE PARK (NMP) AND ACROSS DEPTHS RANGING FROM 30 TO 123 M, PROVIDING A BROAD ASSESSMENT OF THE BIODIVERSITY OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES IN MESOPHOTIC HABITATS OF THE NMP. BENTHIC SLEDS WERE USED TO SAMPLE BIODIVERSITY AND SPECIMENS IDENTIFIED TO THE HIGHEST TAXONOMIC RESOLUTION. SINGLE-BEAM AND MULTIBEAM SURVEYS OF THE SEABED WERE PERFORMED TO DERIVE 58 SPATIAL AND BATHYMETRIC VARIABLES USED TO ASSESS THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF BENTHIC DIVERSITY. A TOTAL OF 787 TAXA WERE IDENTIFIED ACROSS THE FOUR PHYLA, OF WHICH 51\% WERE RARE AND SAMPLED FROM A SINGLE STATION. LATITUDE AND DEPTH WERE SIGNIFICANT IN STRUCTURING THE INVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY IN THE MESOPHOTIC, WITH POINT CLOATES NOTABLY IDENTIFIED AS A SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURE IN PARTITIONING DIVERSITY TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE NMP. DEPTH WAS MORE INFLUENTIAL AT STRUCTURING DIVERSITY IN THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THE NMP DUE TO THE NARROWER NINGALOO SHELF, AND SOUTHERN LOCALITIES INCLUDING TURTLES AND RED BLUFF WERE IDENTIFIED AS BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS FOR BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES. IMPORTANTLY, COMPARISONS OF DIVERSITY WITHIN `NO-TAKE' AND `GENERAL USE' ZONES ALONG THE NMP INDICATE THAT SANCTUARY ZONES REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY CONTAINED IN THE MARINE PARK, THUS HIGHLIGHTING THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF INVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY FOR THE REGION.",10.1007/s12526-019-01015-0,ABDUL WAHAB MA_2019_MAR BIODIVERS,,,,,,,

HERE, WE USED BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO TO DESCRIBE BENTHIC HABITAT AND FISH ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE FROM 10 TO 80 M DEPTH AT APO ISLAND, A WELL-MANAGED MARINE PROTECTED AREA IN THE PHILIPPINES. WE CONDUCTED SURVEYS 2 YR AFTER TWO STORMS (IN 2011 AND 2012) CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO SHALLOW CORAL COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE NO-TAKE MARINE RESERVE (NTMR) OF APO ISLAND, WHICH LED TO DECLINES IN FISH POPULATIONS THAT HAD BUILT UP OVER THREE DECADES. WE FOUND THAT HARD CORAL COVER WAS RESTRICTED TO < 40 M DEEP IN THE STORM-IMPACTED NTMR AND A NEARBY FISHED AREA NOT IMPACTED BY STORMS. BENTHIC COVER AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS (> 30 M) WAS DOMINATED BY SAND/RUBBLE AND ROCK (DEAD CORAL) WITH LOW COVER OF SOFT CORALS, SPONGES AND MACROALGAE. STORM DAMAGE APPEARED TO HAVE REACHED THE DEEPEST LIMIT OF THE FRINGING REEF (40 M) AND REDUCED VARIABILITY IN BENTHIC STRUCTURE WITHIN THE NTMR. SPECIES RICHNESS AND/OR ABUNDANCE OF MOST TROPHIC GROUPS OF FISH DECLINED WITH INCREASING DEPTH REGARDLESS OF STORM DAMAGE. THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN TAXONOMIC AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE AND DEGREE OF TARGETING BY FISHERIES BETWEEN SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC FISH ASSEMBLAGES. THREATENED SHARK SPECIES AND A FISH SPECIES PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED IN THE PHILIPPINES WERE RECORDED AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE A FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE BENTHIC AND FISH ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE OF PHILIPPINE CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS A WIDE DEPTH GRADIENT. THIS WORK ALSO UNDERSCORES HOW A COMBINATION OF LIMITED CORAL REEF DEVELOPMENT AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS CLOSE TO SHALLOW REEFS AND SEVERE HABITAT LOSS CAUSED BY STORMS WOULD RESULT IN MINIMAL DEPTH REFUGE FOR REEF FISH POPULATIONS.",10.1007/s00338-017-1635-0,ABESAMIS RA_2018_CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,

HOWEVER, DEEPER HABITATS SUCH AS MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS (MCES) REMAIN UNDERSTUDIED. WE INVESTIGATED THE DEPTH STRUCTURING OF SHORE-FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN THE CENTRAL PHILIPPINES ACROSS SHALLOW (10-30 M) AND MESOPHOTIC (UPPER: 30-60 M, LOWER: 60-90 M) DEPTH ZONES. BAITED VIDEO SURVEYS IN TWO COASTAL SITES SIMILAR TO 30 KM APART SHOWED STRONG DECLINES WITH DEPTH IN FISH SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE INCLUDING FISHERY TARGET SPECIES. CORALLIVORES, HERBIVORES/DETRITIVORES, OMNIVORES AND PLANKTIVORES SHOWED THE STRONGEST DECLINES. INVERTIVORES AND GENERALIST CARNIVORES DOMINATED ABUNDANCE AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. DATA FROM THE COASTAL SITES WERE ANALYSED WITH PUBLISHED DATA FROM AN OFFSHORE ISLAND (APO ISLAND) < 25 KM AWAY TO PROVIDE BROADER INSIGHTS ON SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF SHORE-FISH DEPTH STRUCTURING. THE PERCENTAGES OF SPECIES THAT OVERLAPPED SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS WERE MUCH LOWER IN COASTAL SITES (9-13\%, 9-11\%) THAN THE ISLAND (20-26\%), SUGGESTING HIGHER POTENTIAL VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE LATTER. MEAN ASSEMBLAGE SIMILARITIES (BRAY-CURTIS) BETWEEN SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC DEPTH ZONES WERE FOUND TO BE LOW AT ALL SITES (0.3-19.6) AND DECREASED WITH DEPTH. FISH ASSEMBLAGES GRADUALLY DIFFERED ACROSS DEPTH ZONES AT COASTAL SITES BUT MESOPHOTIC ASSEMBLAGES AT THE ISLAND WERE MORE SIMILAR TO THE SHALLOW COASTAL ASSEMBLAGES. STRONG CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FISH ASSEMBLAGES AND BENTHIC HABITAT WERE DETECTED, SUGGESTING THAT HIGHER COVER OF ROCKY SUBSTRATUM AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS FACILITATES VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY AT THE ISLAND. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT BENTHIC HABITAT AS A DRIVER OF SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE DEPTH STRUCTURING AND VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY OF SHORE-FISH ASSEMBLAGES.",10.1007/s00227-020-03797-5,ABESAMIS RA_2020_MAR BIOL,,,,,,,

TO CHARACTERIZE INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN THESE COMPOUNDS, WE GENERATED METABOLOMIC PROFILES OF THE CARIBBEAN SPONGE A. TUBULATA ACROSS SPATIAL GRADIENTS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE SITES IN BELIZE AND GRAND CAYMAN, AND DEPTHS RANGING FROM 15 TO 61 M IN GRAND CAYMAN. SAMPLES WERE ALSO ANALYZED FROM A RECIPROCAL TRANSPLANT EXPERIMENT ACROSS SHALLOW (22 M) TO MESOPHOTIC (61 M) REEFS. WE FOUND QUANTITATIVE, BUT NOT QUALITATIVE, DIFFERENCES IN METABOLITE PROFILES ACROSS SITES AND DEPTHS, WITH 9 METABOLITES CONTRIBUTING TO THAT VARIATION. IN ADDITION, TRANSPLANTING SPONGES ACROSS DEPTHS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CONCENTRATIONS OF THE METABOLITE SCEPTRIN. SPONGE EXTRACTS EXHIBITED ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY AGAINST A PANEL OF MARINE AND HUMAN PATHOGENS. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOWED THAT DIFFERENT METABOLITES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY AGAINST DIFFERENT PATHOGENS. THE STRONGEST COMPOUND-SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP WAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF OROIDIN ON THE GROWTH OF SERRATIA MARCESCENS, AND PURIFIED OROIDIN WAS FOUND TO INHIBIT S. MARCESCENS GROWTH IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER. OVERALL, A. TUBULATA EXHIBITS INTRASPECIFIC VARIABILITY IN THE PRODUCTION OF ANTIBACTERIAL SECONDARY METABOLITES ACROSS SITES AND DEPTHS THAT SIGNALS SELECTIVE RESPONSES TO ITS ENVIRONMENT.

Coastal environments such as the intertidal zone and rocky and coral reefs are exposed to
natural disturbances such as tides, storms, hurricanes, and cyclones and human activities such as fishing,
tourism, and pollution. The deep reef refuge hypothesis posits that organisms that can inhabit greater depths
would be less vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, greenhouse warming of the sea surface, and ocean acidification caused by the increased partial pressure of CO2
. Consequently, deep rocky or coral reefs can function
as “insurance” against the effects of climate change. Objective. To analyse biotic and abiotic variables of the
mesophotic ecosystem of Archipelago Espíritu Santo to assess it as a refuge against climate change-related
disturbances. Methods. Bathymetry, profiles of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen; determination of
the euphotic zone, sampling in shallow and deep waters collecting water for analysis of carbonate system,
video transects with remotely operated vehicles for the identification of benthic species and estimation of
their abundance including those of commercial importance or conservation. Calculation of ecological indices
and the reef-functional index. Results. Deepest recorded point was 78m, shallowest mesophotic zone was
11m. Temperature does not show a stratification either in April or in October 2021, but the salinity registers
a peak near 30 m depth, and the dissolved oxygen decreases at 20 m. W Aragonite is below 3.0; there is
spatial variation in the structural indices of the benthic community, and the reef-functional index is between
0.16 and 0.65. Conclusions. There are sharp spatial variations within the same locality, limiting the assertion
that mesophotic ecosystems can serve as a refuge from climate change",10.24275/pqxd5278,AGUILERA LEC_2023_HIDROBIOLOGICA,,,,,,,

The PRC runs parallel to the shelf edge and consists of many narrow, turbid channels where strong tidal currents and eddies foster high suspended loads and phytoplankton production that sustain lush gardens of suspension-feeding, benthic communities. Rates and pathways of benthic carbon decomposition and carbonate kinetics in relation to these characteristics were measured across the shelf. Flux rates of DIC, O2, Mn, and dissolved inorganic nutrients across the sediment–water interface were rapid, increasing from inshore and peaking at the channels within the PRC. Rates of DIC (mean: 39.5 mmol m−2 d−1; range: 14.5–103.2) and  production (mean=5.4 mmol m−2 d−1; range=1.6–23.7) from incubated sediments were rapid compared with other shelves. Sulfate reduction (mean:1.2 mmol S m−2 d−1; range: 0.1–6.1) and iron reduction (mean: 2.7 mmol Fe m−2 d−1; range: 0.6–4.6) were minor diagenetic pathways, measured only in inshore and mid-shelf deposits. Manganese reduction (mean: 12.5 mmol Mn m−2 d−1; range: 0.5–55.9) was the second most important pathway, as sites seaward of the inner shelf were dominated by aerobic respiration (63–99% of total C oxidation). There was no detectable production of either CH4 or N2O. Rates of O2 consumption were rapid (mean: 44.6 mmol m−2 d−1; range: 10.2–121.9) with the percentage of O2 involved in chemical oxidation declining from 90% to 92% inshore to <10% at the shelf edge. From inshore to the mid-shelf reefs, ≈20% of remineralized DIC was involved in carbonate dissolution whereas ≈10% was involved in authigenic mineral formation on the outer shelf and at the shelf edge. N2 production was rapid and much greater than nitrogen fixation but neither showed across-shelf patterns. High tidal energy within the PRC leads to increased exposure of high-quality organic matter to microbes and oxygen, fostering rapid rates of aerobic respiration, manganese reduction, and carbonate dissolution. Our data supports the notion that tropical shelves act as efficient ‘incinerators’ of organic matter.",10.1016/j.csr.2011.05.018,ALONGI DM_2011_CONT SHELF RES,,,,,,,

THE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES, MEASURED AS \% COVER, OF TWO GEOMORPHOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT MESOPHOTIC SITES (EL HOYO AND HOLE-IN-THE-WALL) WERE EXAMINED DURING 2009-2010 IN SOUTHWEST PUERTO RICO. DEPTHS SAMPLED WERE 50 AND 70 M. AT EACH SITE/DEPTH COMBINATION, TWO PERMANENT TRANSECTS, MEASURING 10-M LONG BY 40-CM WIDE, WERE SURVEYED BY SUCCESSIVE PHOTOQUADRANTS, 0.24 M(2) IN AREA. SCLERACTINIAN CORALS, OCTOCORALS, MACROALGAE, CRUSTOSE CORALLINE ALGAE (CCA), SPONGES AND UNCONSOLIDATED SEDIMENT WERE THE MAIN COMPONENTS ALONG THE TRANSECTS. SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BOTH AMONG SITES AND AMONG DEPTHS. DIFFERENCES AMONG SITES WERE GREATER AT 50 M THAN AT 70 M. THE EL HOYO SITE AT 50 M WAS THE MOST DIVERGENT, AND THIS WAS DUE TO A LOWER CORAL AND SPONGE COVER AND A HIGHER ALGAL COVER (AMPHIROA SPP., PEYSSONNELIA IRIDESCENS, TURF) RELATIVE TO THE OTHER SITE/DEPTH COMBINATIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WITH DEPTH WERE LARGER AT EL HOYO THAN AT HOLE-IN-THE-WALL. THE COMMUNITIES AT 70 M WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE AT 50 M BY THE GREATER PROPORTION OF THE CORALS AGARICIA UNDATA, MADRACIS PHARENSIS AND CCA, AND A REDUCED COVER OF THE CYANOBACTERIUM SCHIZOTHRIX. TEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES WAS DOCUMENTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. FOR BOTH MESOPHOTIC SITES, THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE AT 50 M WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN AT 70 M. FOR BOTH DEPTHS, THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE AT EL HOYO WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN AT HOLE-IN-THE-WALL. ALL ASSEMBLAGES EXPERIENCED ALMOST THE SAME TEMPORAL PATTERNS, DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION ACROSS SITES AND DEPTHS. CHANGES IN TEMPORAL PATTERNS ARE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENT COVER OF THE MACROALGAE DICTYOTA SPP., AND A DECREASE IN THE PERCENT COVER OF NON-COLONIZED SUBSTRATA (SAND, PAVEMENT OR RUBBLE). RELATIVELY RAPID, INTRA-ANNUAL CHANGES ARE DICTATED BY THE NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN CYCLIC DICTYOTA SPP. COVER AND OPEN SUBSTRATA COVER.

Profiles obtained with a precision depth recorder indicated the presence of continuous and discontinuous structures on the outer continental shelf and at the shelf-slope break. Most conspicuous was a band of pinnacles, benches, mounds and troughs extending north from Fort Pierce to Cape Canaveral, Florida, and a massive mound occurring off St. Lucie Inlet. These occurred under the western edge of the Florida Current and along the edge of the continental shelf (about 80° W). From Fort Pierce southward to Palm Beach, these structures almost disappear. Dredgings in two selected areas of pronounced vertical profile, and preliminary visual and photographic observations made with the Johnson-Sea-Link I submersible, confirmed the existence of rich, sessile and motile invertebrate assemblages and fish populations associated with exposed limestone bedrock, talus, and the scleractinian coral Oculina varicosa.",10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620201,AVENT RM_1977_INT REV GESAMTEN HYDROBIOL,,,,,,,

THE VERY AUTOTROPHIC SHALLOW-WATER (SIMILAR TO 5 M) CORALS SHOWED LOW OR NO DDN ASSIMILATION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED UNDER ELEVATED PHOSPHATE AVAILABILITY (3 MU M). CORALS THAT DEPENDED MORE ON HETEROTROPHY (I.E., BLEACHED AND DEEP-WATER [SIMILAR TO 45 M] CORALS) ASSIMILATED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DDN, WHICH CONTRIBUTED UP TO 15\% OF THE CORALS ` N DEMAND (COMPARED TO 1\% IN SHALLOW CORALS). FURTHERMORE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE DDN ASSIMILATED BY DEEP CORALS WAS LIKELY OBTAINED FROM HETEROTROPHIC FEEDING ON FIXED N COMPOUNDS AND/OR DIAZOTROPHIC CELLS IN THE MUCUS. CONVERSELY, IN SHALLOW CORALS, THE NET RELEASE OF MUCUS, RICH IN ORGANIC CARBON COMPOUNDS, LIKELY ENHANCED DIAZOTROPH ABUNDANCE AND ACTIVITY AND THEREBY THE RELEASE OF FIXED N TO THE PELAGIC AND BENTHIC REEF COMMUNITY. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DDN ASSIMILATION BY CORALS VARIES ACCORDING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND IS LIKELY LINKED TO THE CAPACITY OF THE CORAL TO ACQUIRE NUTRIENTS FROM SEAWATER. IMPORTANCE TROPICAL CORALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIALIZED BACTERIA (I.E., DIAZOTROPHS) ABLE TO TRANSFORM DINITROGEN (N-2) GAS INTO A BIOAVAILABLE FORM OF NITROGEN, BUT HOW MUCH OF THIS DIAZOTROPH-DERIVED NITROGEN (DDN) IS ASSIMILATED BY CORALS UNDER DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IS STILL UNKNOWN. HERE, WE USED N-15(2) LABELING TO TRACE THE FATE OF DDN WITHIN THE CORAL SYMBIOSIS. WE SHOW THAT DDN IS ASSIMILATED BY BOTH THE ANIMAL HOST AND THE ENDOSYMBIOTIC ALGAE. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF ASSIMILATED DDN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN MESOPHOTIC, BLEACHED, OR PHOSPHORUS-ENRICHED CORALS THAN IN SURFACE CORALS, WHICH ALMOST DID NOT TAKE UP THIS NITROGEN FORM.

The annual gonadal development and sexual reproduction of this species were studied both in shallow water (3-5 m) and in the deep reef zone (27-30 m). P. f. fulvum is a dioecious species. Sex ratio of the shallow population favors higher abundance of females, while on the deep reef a 1:1 sex ratio was recorded. These differences are probably due to local aggregations of colonies of the same sex caused by asexual reproduction. Oocytes and sperm sacs are found even in very young colonies (1-3 years). The frequency of sexually mature males is higher than mature females among small corals. Young oocytes appear annually in August and within 10-11 months reach their maximal diameter. Sperm sacs start to develop later and mature after 7-9 months. A marked synchronization in the development of the oocytes and the testes exists among different polyps within each colony. Spawning occurs at dusk, and is fully synchronized by lunar periodicity (a few days after the new moon and a few days preceeding its last quarter). Fertilization takes place inside the polyp cavities. The shallow water population breeds prior to the deeper one with the whole reproductive period lasting approximately two months (end of June, beginning of August). Among anthozoans, P. f. fulvum represents a unique mode of sexual reproduction and planulae development. This species is oviparous, yet eggs cleave on the surface of the female colonies while entangled in a mucoid suspension. We term this mode of planula development ""surface brooding"". Within 6 days after fertilization the planulae complete their development, detach from the surface of the colony, and sink to the bottom. The encrusting growth form of P. f. fulvum is characterized by a thin coenenchyme and short polyp cavities, yet the eggs exhibit a large diameter (500-700 µm). Egg production of P. f. fulvum is rather low (18-24 eggs per polyp), but it is compensated for by surface brooding, which protects the offspring during embryogenesis. It is suggested that surface brooding is an adaptation to the encrusting shape of the colony and it maximizes fecundity.",10.2307/1541201,BENAYAHU Y_1983_BIOL BULL,,,,,,,

A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BRANCHING PATTERN (COLONY HEIGHT/NUMBER OF BRANCHES) AND AVERAGE GROWTH RATE WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE COLONIES OF THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS GROWTH RATE DECREASES WITH AGE, THIS WAS DUE TO THE DIFFERENT AGE STRUCTURE OF THE TWO SAITIPLES. THE MAXIMUM LIFESPAN WAS FOUND TO BE 106 YEARS, A VALUE NOT DETERMINED PREVIOUSLY FOR C.

THOSE CHANGES CAN BE A POTENTIAL STRESS FACTOR FOR CORAL-REEF ORGANISMS AND AFFECT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CORAL'S PHYSIOLOGY, INCLUDING ITS FLUORESCENCE. FLUORESCENCE IS A PHYSICAL PHENOMENON, COMPRISING THE EMISSION OF LIGHT BY A SUBSTANCE THAT HAS ABSORBED LIGHT WITH A DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH. MAJOR HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THE ROLE OF CORAL FLUORESCENCE INCLUDE THAT OF PHOTOPROTECTION AND THE FACILITATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS. WE SOUGHT TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE SOME ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CORAL FLUORESCENCE. WE FOCUSED ON THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LIGHT CONDITIONS ON FLUORESCENCE OF THE CORAL GALAXEA FASCICULARIS AND USED PHOTOGRAPHY, CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY, AND SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN ITS FLUORESCENCE. WE SHOW THAT FLUORESCENCE IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY LIGHT AND, THEREFORE, BY DEPTH. CORAL FLUORESCENCE INCREASED WITH THE INCREASE IN LIGHT INTENSITY AND WHEN THE SPECTRUM OF LIGHT WAS BROADER. HENCE, WE SUPPORT THE ``SUNSCREEN'' HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUDE THAT FLUORESCENCE PLAYS A ROLE IN THE CORAL'S DEFENSE MECHANISM AGAINST HARMFUL RADIATION.

AS MESOPHOTIC CORALS ARE ALSO HIGHLY FLUORESCENT, AND FLUORESCENCE UNDER HEAT STRESS IS KNOWN TO UNDERGO CHANGE, WE EXAMINED THE INVOLVEMENT OF FLUORESCENCE DURING HEAT-INDUCED BLEACHING, BY INCORPORATING BOTH HIGH- AND LOW-FLUORESCENCE MORPHS IN OUR EXPERIMENTS. WE COLLECTED COLONIES OF THE MESOPHOTIC CORAL ALVEOPORA OCELLATA AND SUBJECTED THEM TO ELEVATED TEMPERATURES IN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER IN CONTROLLED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. WE FOLLOWED THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND THEIR BLEACHING AT A HIGH SAMPLING RESOLUTION (EVERY 48 H FOLLOWING THE TEMPERATURE RAMPING PERIOD). WE FOUND THAT A. OCELLATA BLEACHED AFTER A SHORT-TERM (14 DAYS) THERMAL STRESS OF +4 DEGREES C ABOVE AMBIENT SEA TEMPERATURE DURING THE SUMMER, BUT DID NOT BLEACH DURING THE WINTER DESPITE THE ELEVATED TEMPERATURE (+5 DEGREES C; MAX TEMPERATURE OF 32 DEGREES C AND 28 DEGREES C, RESPECTIVELY). AFTER EXPERIENCING TEMPERATURES HIGHER THAN 29.5 DEGREES C, THE PEAK SUMMER TEMPERATURE, THE CORALS GRADUALLY LOST THEIR ALGAL SYMBIONTS DURING THE SUMMER EXPERIMENT, WHILE EXHIBITING AN INCREASE IN SYMBIONT DENSITY DURING THE WINTER EXPERIMENT.

THE DIFFERENCES FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO MORPHS SUGGEST THAT FLUORESCENCE MAY BE FAVORABLE UNDER THERMAL STRESS, STRENGTHENING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING CORAL FLUORESCENCE AS A NONINVASIVE MONITORING TOOL FOR EARLY DETECTION OF BLEACHING.

ALONG WITH COASTAL ROCKY CLIFFS, ISOLATED CORALLIGENOUS CONCRETIONS EMERGING FROM MUDDY BOTTOMS ARE TYPICAL STRUCTURES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA MESOPHOTIC ZONE. CORALLIGENOUS CONCRETIONS AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS IN THE SOUTH TYRRHENIAN SEA WERE INVESTIGATED TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF THESE CORALLIGENOUS OASES IN RELATION TO THE BIODIVERSITY OF SURROUNDING SOFT SEDIMENTS. WE SHOW HERE THAT THE COMPLEX STRUCTURES OF THE CORALLIGENOUS CONCRETIONS AT CA. 110 M DEPTH INFLUENCE THE TROPHIC CONDITIONS, THE BIODIVERSITY AND ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION IN THE SURROUNDING SEDIMENTS EVEN AT CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES. CORAL CONCRETIONS NOT ONLY REPRESENT DEEP OASES OF CORAL BIODIVERSITY BUT THEY ALSO PROMOTE A HIGHER BIODIVERSITY OF THE FAUNA INHABITING THE SURROUNDING SOFT SEDIMENTS. USING THE BIODIVERSITY OF NEMATODES AS A PROXY OF THE TOTAL BENTHIC BIODIVERSITY, A HIGH TURNOVER BIODIVERSITY WITHIN A 200 M DISTANCE FROM THE CORALLIGENOUS CONCRETIONS WAS OBSERVED. SUCH TURNOVER IS EVEN MORE EVIDENT WHEN ONLY RARE TAXA ARE CONSIDERED AND SEEMS RELATED TO SPECIFIC TROPHIC CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE CORALLIGENOUS STRUCTURES. THE PRESENCE OF A HIGH TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY AND THE TROPHIC ENRICHMENT MAKE THESE HABITATS HIGHLY BIODIVERSE, NOWADAYS ENDANGERED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES ( SUCH AS EXPLOITATION OF COMMERCIAL SPECIES SUCH AS CORALLIUM RUBRUM, OR TRAWLING FISHERIES, WHICH DIRECTLY CAUSES HABITAT DESTRUCTION OR INDIRECTLY CAUSES MODIFICATION IN THE SEDIMENTATION AND RE-SUSPENSION RATES). WE STRESS THAT THE PROTECTION OF THE CORALLIGENOUS SEA CONCRETIONS IS A PRIORITY FOR FUTURE CONSERVATION POLICIES AT THE SCALE OF LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND THAT A COMPLETE CENSUS OF THESE MESOPHOTIC OASES OF BIODIVERSITY SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.",10.1371/journal.pone.0066553,BIANCHELLI S_2013_PLOS ONE,,,,,,,

EXCEPT ALONG THE EXPOSED WINDWARD MARGIN WHERE CORAL GROWTH IS DOMINANT, THE UPPER TERRACE (0-10 M BSL) LARGELY CONSISTS OF A BARREN ROCKY PAVEMENT TRAVERSED BY EROSIONAL FURROWS. EXPOSURE RELATED TRENDS IN THE MORPHOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THESE EROSIONAL FEATURES, AND THE LACK OF CORAL GROWTH, DEMONSTRATES THAT THE TERRACE IS THE RESULT OF CONTEMPORARY EROSION DURING SEASONAL STORMS. THE UPPER TERRACE IS TERMINATED BY A MID-SHELF SCARP (10-20 M BSL) THAT, IN MOST AREAS, IS PARTIALLY TO COMPLETELY BURIED BY MODERN CARBONATE DEPOSITS. ALONG NARROW SECTIONS OF THE LEEWARD SHELF, THE SCARP IS COMMONLY EXPOSED AND DISPLAYS AN EROSIONAL INTERTIDAL NOTCH AT -18.5 M. THE LOWER TERRACE (12-40 M BSL) EXTENDS FROM THE MID-SHELF SCARP TO THE SHELF EDGE. ITS SURFACE IS A MODERN REEF-AND-SEDIMENT WEDGE THAT THICKENS TOWARD THE SHELF EDGE, REACHING UP TO 40 M IN THICKNESS. THESE DEPOSITS ARE UNDERLAIN BY A SEAWARD-SLOPING BEDROCK TERRACE (20-40 M BSL). THIS BURIED TERRACE AND THE MID-SHELF SCARP, WHICH ARE GEOMORPHIC EQUIVALENTS OF THE UPPER TERRACE AND COASTAL CLIFF, REPRESENT AN EARLIER EPISODE OF MARINE PLANATION WHEN SEALEVEL WAS STABILIZED AT A LOWER POSITION. THE CONTEMPORARY EROSIONAL FEATURES OF THE UPPER-SHELF TERRACE AND THE PRESENCE OF IDENTICAL TERRACES AROUND RECENTLY UPLIFTED ISLANDS DEMONSTRATES THAT THE TERRACES ON GRAND CAYMAN WERE SCULPTURED BY MARINE EROSION DURING THE LAST DEGLACIAL SEA-LEVEL RISE. THE LOWER TERRACE AND THE MID-SHELF SCARP WERE ERODED DURING A SLOW-RISE EPISODE FROM 11-7 KA AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DROWNED BY AN EXTREMELY RAPID, 5 M RISE-EVENT AT SIMILAR TO 7 KA. FOLLOWING THIS CATASTROPHIC EVENT, WHICH DROWNED FAST-GROWING ACROPORA REEFS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CARIBBEAN, SEA-LEVEL STABILIZED AND ROSE SLOWLY TO ITS PRESENT POSITION, PRODUCING THE UPPER TERRACE. THIS PRONOUNCED STEPPED PATTERN IN HOLOCENE SEA-LEVEL RISE REMAINS TO BE CONFIRMED FROM OUTSIDE THE CARIBBEAN-ATLANTIC REEF PROVINCE BUT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STEPPED NATURE OF PRE-HOLOCENE SEA-LEVEL CURVES. THE PRESENCE OF SEAWARD SLOPING TERRACES ON MANY SHELVES AROUND THE WORLD SUGGESTS THAT EROSIONAL TERRACE CUTTING IS A COMMON PHENOMENON DURING SEA-LEVEL RISE. IN CONTRAST, TERRACES IN AREAS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL FALL ARE CONSTRUCTIONAL IN ORIGIN, PRODUCED ENTIRELY BY REEF ACCRETION. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A GENETIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEA-LEVEL CYCLE AND TERRACE TYPE: EROSIONAL TERRACES FORM DURING RISE AND CONSTRUCTIONAL TERRACES DURING FALL.",NA,BLANCHON P_1995_J COAST RES,,,,,,,
BLANCHON P,1997,SEDIMENTOLOGY,HURRICANE CONTROL ON SHELF-EDGE-REEF ARCHITECTURE AROUND GRAND CAYMAN,NA,"RIMMING THE OUTER SHELF OF GRAND CAYMAN IS A SUBMERGED, 87 KM LONG SHELF-EDGE REEF THAT RISES TO WITHIN 12 M OF MEAN SEA LEVEL. IT CONSISTS OF AN ARRAY OF CORAL-ARMOURED BUTTRESSES ALIGNED PERPENDICULAR TO SHORE AND SEPARATED BY STEEP-SIDED SEDIMENT-FLOORED CANYONS. INDIVIDUAL BUTTRESSES HAVE A DIVERSE CORAL-DOMINATED BIOTA AND CONSIST OF THREE ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS: A SHIELD-LIKE FRONT WALL COLONIZED BY PLATY CORALS, A DOME-SHAPED CROWN COLONIZED BY HEAD CORALS, AND A SHOREWARD-PROJECTING SPUR COVERED BY VARYING AMOUNTS OF BRANCHING CORAL. BUTTRESSES ARE COMMONLY FRONTED BY CORAL PINNACLES THAT, IN SOME AREAS, HAVE AMALGAMATED WITH BUTTRESS WALLS TO PRODUCE PINNACLE-AND-ARCH STRUCTURES. AS MARGIN ORIENTATION CHANGES, SHELF-EDGE-REEF ARCHITECTURE SHOWS SYSTEMATIC VARIATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN FETCH AND HEIGHT OF HURRICANE WAVES. ALONG MARGINS EXPOSED TO FULLY DEVELOPED STORM WAVES, SHELF-EDGE-REEF BUTTRESSES ARE DEEP, HAVE LARGE AMPLITUDES, AND ARE DOMINATED BY ROBUST HEAD CORALS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE CONSISTENT WITH HURRICANE-INDUCED PRUNING OF BRANCHING CORALS AND THE FLUSHING OF SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF SAND FROM BUTTRESS CANYONS BY RETURN FLOWS. ALONG MARGINS IMPACTED BY FETCH-LIMITED STORM WAVES, REEF BUTTRESSES ARE SHALLOWER, HAVE INTERMEDIATE-AMPLITUDES, AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROPORTION OF BRANCHING CORALS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE CONSISTENT WITH LESS CORAL PRUNING AND SAND FLUSHING BY WEAKER HURRICANE WAVES. ALONG MARGINS FULLY PROTECTED FROM STORM WAVES, THE BUTTRESSES-CANYON ARCHITECTURE OF THE SHELF-EDGE REEF BREAKS DOWN PRODUCING A SERIES OF SHALLOW, UNDULATING, BRANCHING-CORAL-DOMINATED RIDGES THAT MERGE LATERALLY INTO AN UNBROKEN BELT OF CORAL. THESE CHARACTERISTICS CORRESPOND WITH NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNTS OF PRUNING AND FLUSHING DURING HURRICANES. IN ADDITION TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MARGINS, LOCAL INTRA-MARGINAL CHANGES IN SHELF-EDGE REEF ARCHITECTURE ARE CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN THE ANGLE OF HURRICANE-WAVE APPROACH. OPEN SECTIONS OF THE SHELF-EDGE REEF, WHICH FACE DIRECTLY INTO STORM WAVES, ARE PRUNED OF BRANCHING CORALS AND THE FRAGMENTS SWEPT BACK ONTO THE SHELF PRODUCING EXTENSIVE SPURS. BY CONTRAST, ON MORE SHELTERED, OBLIQUELY ORIENTATED SECTIONS, STORM-WAVES SWEEP DEBRIS ALONG AND OFF SHELF PRODUCING LITTLE OR NO SPUR DEVELOPMENT. INSTEAD, THE DEBRIS SHED SEAWARDS ACCUMULATES IN FRONT OF THE BUTTRESS WALLS AND INITIATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CORAL PINNACLES. OVER TIME, REPEATED BUTTRESS PRUNING AND CANYON FLUSHING DURING HURRICANES NOT ONLY CONTROLS REEF ARCHITECTURE BUT MAY ALSO INFLUENCE ACCRETION PATTERNS. VERTICAL ACCRETION IS LIMITED BY THE EFFECTIVE DEPTH OF STORM-WAVE FRAGMENTATION. ONCE THIS HURRICANE-ACCRETION THRESHOLD IS REACHED THE REEF MOVES INTO A SHEDDING PHASE AND ACCRETES LATERALLY VIA PINNACLE GROWTH, AMALGAMATION, AND INFILLING, CONSEQUENTLY, THE REEF STEPS OUT OVER ITS OWN DEBRIS IN A KIND OF BALANCING ACT BETWEEN LATERAL GROWTH AND SLOPE FAILURE - A PATTERN WIDELY RECOGNIZED IN ANCIENT REEFS.",10.1046/j.1365-3091.1997.d01-32.x,BLANCHON P_1997_SEDIMENTOLOGY,,,,,,,

FECUNDITY OF THIS DEPTH-GENERALIST CORAL FROM 4 TO 40 M WAS MEASURED HISTOLOGICALLY, AND POLYP, POPULATION, AND TOTAL HABITAT FECUNDITIES WERE THEN EXTRAPOLATED ACROSS THE SPECIES' DEPTH RANGE. THE NUMBER OF REPRODUCTIVELY ACTIVE FEMALE GONADS PER POLYP AND OOCYTE SIZE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT, THOUGH SMALL, DECREASE WITH DEPTH, POTENTIALLY DUE TO ENERGETIC LIMITATIONS. NOTABLY, THE POPULATION SEX RATIO WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM 1:1 ON SHALLOW AND MID-DEPTH REEFS, BUT IT BECAME SIGNIFICANTLY MALE-BIASED (3.6:1) AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. POPULATION-LEVEL DIFFERENCES IN OOCYTE PRODUCTION OVER DEPTH WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN CORAL COVER AND SEX RATIO. THE LARGE SPATIAL EXTENT OF MESOPHOTIC REEFS RELATIVE TO SHALLOW REEFS IN THE USVI MAKES MCES THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR OF OOCYTES, DESPITE THE REDUCED PROPORTION OF FEMALES AT DEPTH.

IN THE MAIN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS, EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND MANAGE CORAL-REEF FISHERIES ARE UNDERWAY. HOWEVER, THE INCLUSION OF MCES WITHIN MANAGEMENT PLANS HAS BEEN LIMITED BY A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE TROPHIC STRUCTURE OF RESIDENT FISH COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE OF PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING DEPTH, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE DIETS OF SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC FISH WOULD DIFFER, WITH MESOPHOTIC FISH RELYING LESS ON BENTHIC MACROALGAE AND MORE ON HIGHER TROPHIC-LEVEL PREY. TO ADDRESS THESE POSSIBLE ECOLOGICAL DIETARY CHANGES, WE EXAMINED THE BULK TISSUE NITROGEN AND CARBON ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF 319 SAMPLES OF REEF FISH FROM SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS, FURTHER ANALYZING THE AMINO ACID NITROGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF 81 SAMPLES.

USING THE GREAT BARRIER REEF AS A CASE STUDY, HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELLING IS USED TO PREDICT THE DISTRIBUTION OF DEEP-WATER CORAL REEF COMMUNITIES ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF, AUSTRALIA.

LOCATION: GREAT BARRIER REEF, AUSTRALIA. METHODS: MAXIMUM ENTROPY MODELLING IS USED TO IDENTIFY THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF TWO BROAD COMMUNITIES OF HABITAT-FORMING MEGABENTHOS PHOTOTROPHS AND HETEROTROPHS. MODELS WERE GENERATED USING COMBINATIONS OF GEOPHYSICAL SUBSTRATE PROPERTIES DERIVED FROM MULTIBEAM BATHYMETRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA DERIVED FROM BIO-ORACLE, COMBINED WITH GEOREFERENCED OCCURRENCE RECORDS OF MESOPHOTIC CORAL COMMUNITIES FROM AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE, REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE AND SCUBA SURVEYS.

However, our knowledge base suffers a dearth of data from the deep reefs (>40 m). In a recent survey of the deep reefs of the northern Gulf of Aqaba (<65 m), we examined the bathymetric distribution of 26 diurnal zooplanktivorous species. In sharp contrast to the general trend known from the literature and from this research, the abundance of juvenile zebra angelfish, Genicanthus caudovittatus, peaked at deeper waters (60–65 m) compared with the adults (30 m). This suggests that the deeper reefs may serve as nursery grounds for the zebra angelfish. Peak juvenile abundance coincided with relatively low predator abundances. This raises the question, which factors constrain the bathymetric distribution of the remaining species. Our findings stress the potential importance of deep coral reef research for understanding the ecological patterns and processes that govern reef community structure.",10.1007/s10641-006-9160-y,BROKOVICH E_2007_ENVIRON BIOL FISHES,,,,,,,

THE NUMBER OF REEF FISH SPECIES DECLINED WITH DEPTH AND WE ALSO MEASURED A HIGH SPECIES TURNOVER AS MEASURED BY BETA DIVERSITY (BETA(T), BETA(W)) IN THE DEEP REEF.

BUCHANAN JB,1958,J ZOOL,"THE BOTTOM FAUNA COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL SHELF OFF ACCRA, GHANA (GOLD COAST)",NA,"A quantitative investigation of the marine bottom fauna has been earned out, in conjunction with an analysis of the physical environment, across the continental shelf off Accra from the shore to a depth of fifty fathoms.
The concept of “community” used in the present work is discussed and defined.
Although the nature of the bottom sediment is of primary importance, wave action in shallow water and temperature in deeper water are important factors in community differentiation.
Four distinct infaunal communities have been recognised associated with four different types of bottom conditions, these are:
(a) The Inshore Fine Sand Community (0 to eight fathoms), dominated by the polychaetes Owenia fusiformis and Diopaira nea/polilana with the lamellibranch Cultellus tenuis.
(b)The Sandy Silt Community (8–20 fathoms), with Turritdla annvMa and Sternaspis scutata.
(c)The Silty Sand Community (20–25 fathoms), dominated by two species of Foraminifera–Jullienellajoetida and Schizammina sp.
(d)The Coarse Sand Community (25–50 fathoms), dominated by the coral Caryophyllia clavus.
At depths greater than fifty fathoms a rock epifauna exists which is Mediterranean in nature and contains many new faunal records for West Africa. It is characterised by massive colonies of the coral Dendrophyllia ramea and large numbers of the basket star Astrospartus mediterraneus. The bottom temperature at this depth varies little from similar depths in Northwest Africa and the Mediterranean.
The communities off Accra are clear cut and well defined and this is considered to be largely due to the rapidly changing nature of the bottom deposits across the shelf. These rapid changes in bottom conditions are caused first of all, in shallow water, by the sorting action of the surf waves on the bottom deposits. In deeper water a second transition is brought about by the production of coarse sediment from the erosion of a limestone deposit on the outer shelf edge.",10.1111/j.1096-3642.1958.tb00562.x,BUCHANAN JB_1958_J ZOOL,,,,,,,

SEDIMENT TRAPS WERE SET AT 40 M BELOW SEA LEVEL ON TOP OF A BENTHIC CARBONATE DOME, FORMED NEAR THE CORNEA OIL AND GAS FIELD, WHICH WAS VISIBLY LEAKING OIL AND GAS AROUND ITS EDGES IN SIMILAR TO 90 M OF WATER. OTHER TRAPS WERE SET AT THE CONTINENTAL SHELF EDGE AT 100 M AND 400 M BELOW SEA LEVEL ON THE 500 M BATHYMETRIC CONTOUR TO GAUGE THE LONG RANGE DISPERSION OF THE CORNEA SEEP. SEDIMENT CORES FROM THE TRAP SITES AND OTHER RELEVANT SITES WERE ALSO COLLECTED. SEA SURFACE MICROLAYER SAMPLES OF THE OIL SLICKS EMERGING WITH GAS BUBBLES WERE ALSO SAMPLED. THESE WERE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE OIL AS IT MOVED FROM SURFACE SLICKS, THROUGH SETTLING PARTICLES, TO SURFACE SEDIMENT. DOWNWARD FLUXES OF TOTAL HYDROCARBONS (THC) RANGED FROM SIMILAR TO 500 MU G M(-2) D(-1) AT THE SHALLOW CORNEA SEEP SITE TO SIMILAR TO 100 MU G M(-2) D(-1) IN 100 M DEPTH TRAPS AT THE OFFSHORE STATIONS. FLUXES OF OIL POLYNUCLEAR AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAH) RANGED FROM SIMILAR TO 6000 NG M(-2) D(-1) AT CORNEA TO SIMILAR TO 1000 NG M(-2) D(-1) AT OFF SHORE STATIONS. PRINCIPAL HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (HCA-PCA) OF THE PETROLEUM BIOMARKERS CONFIRMED THAT THE SURFACE SLICK SAMPLES AND SEDIMENT TRAPS FROM CORNEA AND SOME OF THE OFFSHORE TRAPS HAD SIMILAR HYDROCARBON COMPOSITIONS. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE OFFSHORE TRAPS ALSO CONTAINED HYDROCARBONS FROM AN APPARENTLY DIFFERENT SOURCE. THIS SECOND SOURCE APPEARED TO BE ``BACKGROUND OIL'' PROBABLY DUE TO A MIXTURE OF NATURAL SEEPS, OIL INDUSTRY ACTIVITIES, OR RELEASE FROM SHIPPING TRAFFIC, AND WAS SIMILAR IN COMPOSITION TO THAT SEEN IN PREVIOUS SEDIMENT TRAP STUDIES ON THE NORTHWEST SHELF THE CORNEA SEEP AREA WAS DEEMED A SIGNIFICANT POINT SOURCE OF OIL AND GAS TO THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS DISPERSED BY TIDAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL SHELF AND CONTRIBUTED TO SETTLING PARTICLES UP TO 300 KM AWAY ON THE CONTINENTAL SLOPE OF THE TIMOR SEA. AN EXTENSION OF A DIAGENESIS MODEL SHOWED THAT 44 TO 77\% OF THE (THC) AND 27 TO 83\% OF THE (PAH) WERE DEGRADED IN THE WATER COLUMN. OF THE REMAINING OIL REACHING THE SEDIMENT SURFACE 99 TO SIMILAR TO 100\% OF THC AND 98 TO SIMILAR TO 100\% OF PAH WERE DEGRADED IN THE NEAR SURFACE SEDIMENTS. MICROBIAL BIOMARKERS INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF SULPHATE REDUCING BACTERIA IN BOTH SEDIMENT TRAPS AND SEDIMENTS AND ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS OF THE MARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH ARCHAEA WHICH TOGETHER ACCOMPLISH THE ANOXIC OXIDATION OF METHANE (AOM). RATHER THAN THIS WELL KNOWN DEEP SEA MICROBIAL CONSORTIA, AEROBIC HYDROCARBON OXIDIZING BACTERIA CONSTITUTED A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE BACTERIAL COMMUNITY IN THE SURFACE SEDIMENT LAYER ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGEST SEEP PLUME OBSERVED AT THE CORNEA SEEP AREA. THESE HYDROCARBON DEGRADERS WERE NOT VISIBLE IN THE OFFSHORE SEDIMENTS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF OTHER MICROBES. THE RAPID WATER COLUMN AND SURFACE SEDIMENT DEGRADATION RATES INDICATED THAT THE TIMOR SEA IS WELL ADAPTED TO DEGRADE NATURAL OIL SEEPS. THIS RAPID DEGRADATION RATE MAKES DETECTION DIFFICULT FOR SPECIFIC OIL BIOMARKERS DUE TO LOW HYDROCARBON CONCENTRATIONS IN SEDIMENTS. SUCH STUDIES ARE MORE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED WITH SEDIMENT TRAP DEPLOYMENTS. ",10.1016/j.marchem.2009.11.010,BURNS KA_2010_MAR CHEM,,,,,,,

LITTLE IS KNOWN HOWEVER WHY CERTAIN SPECIES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE. THIS STUDY EXAMINES CORAL DISEASE PREVALENCE AND SPECIES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISEASE USING DATA COLLECTED OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD AT 25 SITES IN THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. TWELVE SPECIES OF SCLERACTINIAN CORAL WERE FOUND TO BE AFFECTED BY DISEASE. YELLOW BAND DISEASE (YBD) AND DARK SPOTS DISEASE (DSD) WERE THE MOST COMMON DISEASES FOUND ON USVI REEFS. FOUR DISEASES, YBD, DSD, WHITE SYNDROME, AND BLACK BAND DISEASE (BBD) WERE OBSERVED IN THREE SPECIES; MONTASTRAEA ANNULARIS, MONTASTRAEA FRANKSI AND SIDERESTREA SIDEREA. SIDERESTREA SIDEREA WAS MOST FREQUENTLY AFFECTED BY DISEASE WITH A TOTAL PREVALENCE OF 23\%, LARGELY DUE TO THE HIGH NUMBER OF INCIDENCES OF DSD. YBD WAS THE SECOND MOST COMMON DISEASE AND HAD THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE IN MONFASTRAEA ANNULARIS (5.1\%). BBD WAS MOST COMMON IN COLPOPHYLLIA NATANS (1.2\%) WHILE WHITE SYNDROME WAS MOST OFTEN SEEN IN THE MONTASTRAEA ANNULARIS COMPLEX (2.9\%). FOUR OF THE 12 SPECIES AFFECTED BY DISEASE HAD ABOVE AVERAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISEASE, AND INCLUDED SPECIES IN THE MONTASTRAE GENUS AS WELL AS SIDERASTREA SIDEREA. OF THE 12 SPECIES WITH SIGNS OF DISEASE, DIPLORIA STRIGOSA WAS AFFLICTED LEAST, SHOWING ONLY SLIGHT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO YBD. TWO SPECIES OF SCLERACTINIAN CORAL, PORITES PORITES AND DIPLORIA LABRYNTHIFORMIS, AND TWO SPECIES OF HYDROCORAL, MILLEPORA ALCICORNIS AND M.

ANALYSIS USED TO SUPPORT ITS GLOBAL THREATENED STATUS INCLUDED BASIC PARAMETERS, SUCH AS NUMBERS SEEN IN A YEAR AND SPATIAL MAPS OF POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS, BUT INCLUDED NO STATISTICAL APPROACHES TO INTERPRET ABUNDANCE TRENDS. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF MARBLED GROUPER STATUS AND TRENDS, WE USED THE SOUTHEAST AREA MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT PROGRAM REEF FISH VIDEO SURVEY TIME SERIES IN THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO, USA, TO ESTIMATE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE, PROPORTION OF POSITIVE STATIONS, AND THE IMPACT OF HABITAT VARIABLES ON FISH ABUNDANCE. MARBLED GROUPER WERE CONSISTENTLY OBSERVED IN LOW NUMBERS ON THE LOUISIANA SHELF-EDGE BANKS THROUGHOUT THE SURVEY. GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS USING A NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DATA DISTRIBUTION SHOWED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR THE PRESENCE OF REEF AND DEPTH, WHILE THE PERCENT COVERAGE OF ROCK WAS MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT DETECTION AND ABUNDANCE OF MARBLED GROUPER ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RUGOSITY AND DEEP (60-100 M) REEF TRACTS. INTERPRETATION OF ANNUAL TRENDS WAS DIFFICULT DUE TO HIGH INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY, BUT THE DATA APPEAR TO SHOW NO DETECTABLE TRENDS. GIVEN THAT THE PREVIOUS CLASSIFICATION OF NEAR THREATENED WAS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE CONSISTENT BUT RARE OBSERVATION OF THE SPECIES IN ITS PREFERRED HABITAT ON A GLOBAL BASIS, AND GIVEN THAT THE ANNUAL INDICES PRODUCED FOR THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO REGION WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE, WE RECOMMEND THAT THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE REGIONAL STATUS BE MAINTAINED.

HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF STUDIES AND KNOWLEDGE OF TME DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY REMAINS LIMITED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY RESTRICTED. THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION ON HOW ASSEMBLAGES VARY ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS AND WITH DEPTH FOR MOST REGIONS ALSO LIMITS OUR CAPACITY TO DELIMIT CONSERVATION AREAS AND DEVISE MANAGEMENT PLANS EFFECTIVELY. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON TME FROM CENTRAL CHILE AND DESCRIBES THE DEPTH DISTRIBUTION OF REEF FISHES AND BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES AND ALGAE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF TOWED UNDERWATER VIDEO SURVEYS BETWEEN 4.7-95.5 M IN MULTIPLE SITES, WE SHOW THAT TOTAL REEF FISH DENSITY AND RICHNESS DECREASE WITH DEPTH BUT INCREASE WITH LOCAL TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY. THE DEPTH-RELATED DENSITY VARIES AMONG FISH SPECIES AND TROPHIC GROUPS, AND IT REVERSES IN THE CASE OF SEBASTES OCULATUS, WHICH INCREASES IN DENSITY WITH DEPTH. SPONGES AND GORGONIANS DOMINATE BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES BELOW 20 M DEPTH, AND BRACHIOPODS AND ANEMONES INCREASE BELOW 40 AND 60 M, RESPECTIVELY. SOME OF THESE SPECIES FORM ANIMAL FORESTS WHICH, TO SOME EXTENT, REPLACE THE SHALLOW-WATER KELP FORESTS AS STRUCTURAL HABITAT PROVIDERS.

FIRSTLY, WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESES THAT (1) MESOPHOTIC AREAS REPRESENT `THERMAL AND/OR REPRODUCTIVE REFUGIA' FOR THE SPECIES, AND (2) STRONG GENETIC BREAKS SEPARATE THE CORAL POPULATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT SUB-BASINS OF THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA. SECONDLY, WE AIMED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF HARVESTING ON THE GENETIC FEATURES OF POPULATIONS. GENETIC ANALYSES POINTED OUT THE OCCURRENCE OF SIGNIFICANT GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION (OVERALL F (ST) = 0.115, P VALUE = 0) AND AN ISOLATION-BY-DISTANCE PATTERN.

MICROSATELLITE MARKERS REVEALED HIGH LEVELS OF INBREEDING, HETEROZYGOTE DEFICITS, AND SIGNIFICANT GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN AND WITHIN AREAS AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS, WITH AN ASSOCIATED ` ISOLATION BY DISTANCE' PATTERN. 3. THESE RESULTS INDICATED THAT FOR PRECIOUS CORAL POPULATIONS IN SARDINIA THE ` DEEP REEF REFUGIA HYPOTHESIS', THAT ENVISAGES THE CAPACITY FOR DEEP CORALS TO ACT AS SEED BANKS FOR THE SHALLOWER IMPAIRED (OVER-HARVESTED) POPULATIONS, IS NOT SUPPORTED. 4. THE HIGHEST GENETIC DIVERSITY RECORDED IN SARDINIA FOR ALL AREAS AND DEPTHS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER MEDITERRANEAN AREAS INDICATES THAT THE STRICT LOCAL MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE, SINCE HARVESTING HAS NOT YET LED TO A SUBSTANTIAL EROSION OF THE GENETIC POOL. 5.

THE PIPELINE ROUTE INTERFERED WITH 30 OUTCROPS BETWEEN 50 AND 80 M DEPTH, MOSTLY COLONIZED BY 15 TAXA/MORPHOLOGICAL GROUPS. A FUNCTIONAL/CONSERVATIVE APPROACH WAS ADOPTED TO RECOGNIZE THE TAXA/MORPHOLOGICAL GROUPS ON WHICH TO FOCUS THE REMOVAL AND FOLLOWING RELOCATION ACTIVITIES BASED ON THEIR ABUNDANCE, CONSERVATION STATUS, AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS. SATURATION DIVERS TEAMS, ROV PILOT TECHNICIANS, AND RESEARCHERS COLLABORATED TO MINIMIZE THE PHYSICAL IMPACT AND THE LOSS OF ORGANISMS DUE TO THE PIPELINE INSTALLATION. THEY RELOCATED A TOTAL OF 899 LIVING PORTIONS (NUCLEI) FROM THE 30 INTERFERED REEFS ON THE TOP OF THE PIPELINE. THE FOLLOWING MONITORING ACTIVITIES, CARRIED OUT AFTER FOURTEEN MONTHS SINCE THE INTERVENTION, REVEALED A HIGH MEAN SURVIVAL RATE (88.1\%) AND SLIGHT VARIATIONS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE NUCLEI ASSEMBLAGES. THIS STUDY REPRESENTS A PARADIGMATIC CASE OF INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORT OF THE PRIVATE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TO MITIGATE HABITAT LOSS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, AND STRESSES THE NEED FOR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT INVOLVING DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE EXPLOITATION OF MARINE RESOURCES THROUGH ANTE OPERAM ASSESSMENT AND ACTIVE RESTORATION ACTIONS.",10.3389/fmars.2022.877325,CASOLI E_2022_FRONT MAR SCI,,,,,,,

HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL A GAP IN THIS FIELD REGARDING HOW TO EFFICIENTLY SAMPLE LARVAE, PARTICULARLY IN WARM AND NUTRIENT-POOR WATERS. WE EVALUATED THE DIFFERENCES FOUND IN LARVAE CAUGHT WITH TWO MESH SIZE NETS (330 AND 500 MU M) SAMPLED IN THE OPEN OCEAN: SHELF BREAK AND SLOPE (EQUATORIAL SW ATLANTIC). IN TOTAL, 792 LARVAE WERE SAMPLED, REPRESENTING 14 ORDERS AND 55 FAMILIES. OVERALL, LARVAL DENSITY WAS LOW, AND NO DIFFERENCE IN DENSITY WAS DETECTED BETWEEN THE TWO NET SIZES (IND.100 M-3). HOWEVER, A GREATER NUMBER OF TAXA (46 FAMILIES) WERE FOUND IN THE SMALLER NET (300 MU M) THAN IN THE LARGER (500 MU M) (37). MOREOVER, 30.2\% OF FAMILIES WERE FOUND ONLY IN THE 330 MU M NET, WHEREAS 9.4\% WERE FOUND ONLY IN THE 500 MU M NET. A TOTAL OF 60.4\% OF TAXA WERE COMMON TO BOTH NETS. GONOSTOMATIDAE, PARALEPIDIDAE, SCOMBRIDAE, CARANGIDAE, PHOSICHTHYIDAE, AND THE REEF-ASSOCIATED FAMILIES SCARIDAE AND GOBIIDAE WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT TAXA IN THE SMALLER NET.

IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING FISH AGGREGATIONS (PARTICULARLY DURING SPAWNING EVENTS) ARE OFTEN TOP PRIORITIES FOR COASTAL MANAGERS. HOWEVER, THE RAPID MAPPING OF THESE AGGREGATIONS USING CONVENTIONAL SURVEY METHODS (E. G., NON-TECHNICAL SCUBA DIVING AND REMOTELY OPERATED CAMERAS) ARE LIMITED BY DEPTH, VISIBILITY AND TIME. ACOUSTIC SENSORS (I.E., SPLITBEAM AND MULTIBEAM ECHOSOUNDERS) ARE NOT CONSTRAINED BY THESE SAME LIMITATIONS, AND WERE USED TO CONCURRENTLY MAP AND QUANTIFY THE LOCATION, DENSITY AND SIZE OF REEF FISH ALONG WITH SEAFLOOR STRUCTURE IN TWO, SEPARATE LOCATIONS IN THE U. S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. REEF FISH AGGREGATIONS WERE DOCUMENTED ALONG THE SHELF EDGE, AN ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT ECOTONE IN THE REGION. FISH WERE GROUPED INTO THREE CLASSES ACCORDING TO BODY SIZE, AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE BENTHIC SEASCAPE WERE MODELED IN ONE AREA USING BOOSTED REGRESSION TREES. THESE MODELS WERE VALIDATED IN A SECOND AREA TO TEST THEIR PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE IN LOCATIONS WHERE FISH HAVE NOT BEEN MAPPED. MODELS PREDICTING THE DENSITY OF LARGE FISH (>= 29 CM) PERFORMED WELL (I.E., AUC = 0.77). WATER DEPTH AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF DEPTH WERE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PREDICTORS AT TWO SPATIAL SCALES (100 AND 300 M). MODELS OF SMALL (<= 11 CM) AND MEDIUM (12-28 CM) FISH PERFORMED POORLY (I.E., AUC = 0.49 TO 0.68) DUE TO THE HIGH PREVALENCE (45-79\%) OF SMALLER FISH IN BOTH LOCATIONS, AND THE UNEQUAL PREVALENCE OF SMALLER FISH IN THE TRAINING AND VALIDATION AREAS. INTEGRATING ACOUSTIC SENSORS WITH SPATIAL MODELING OFFERS A NEW AND RELIABLE APPROACH TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY FISH AGGREGATIONS AND TO PREDICT THE DENSITY LARGE FISH IN UN-SURVEYED LOCATIONS.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS (PARTICULARLY AROUND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS) BECAUSE IT IS LOGISTICALLY CHALLENGING AND EXPENSIVE TO GATHER DATA IN THE 30 TO 150 METER DEPTH RANGE WHERE THESE ORGANISMS TYPICALLY LIVE. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO BEGIN TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY MODELLING AND PREDICTING THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THREE GENERA OF MESOPHOTIC HARD CORALS OFFSHORE OF MAUI IN THE MAIN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. MAXIMUM ENTROPY MODELING SOFTWARE WAS USED TO CREATE SEPARATE MAPS OF PREDICTED PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE AND UNCERTAINTY FOR: (1) LEPTOSERIS, (2) MONTIPORA, AND (3) PORITES. GENERA PREVALENCE WAS DERIVED FROM THE IN SITU PRESENCE/ABSENCE DATA, AND USED TO CONVERT RELATIVE HABITAT SUITABILITY TO PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE VALUES. APPROXIMATELY 1,300 GEOREFERENCED RECORDS OF THE OCCURRENCE OF MHC, AND 34 ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTORS WERE USED TO TRAIN THE MODEL ENSEMBLES. RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) VALUES WERE BETWEEN 0.89 AND 0.97, INDICATING EXCELLENT OVERALL MODEL PERFORMANCE. MEAN UNCERTAINTY AND MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR FOR THE SPATIAL PREDICTIONS RANGED FROM 0.006\% TO 0.05\% AND 3.73\% TO 17.6\%, RESPECTIVELY. DEPTH, DISTANCE FROM SHORE, EUPHOTIC DEPTH (MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION) AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION) WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE SIX MOST INFLUENTIAL PREDICTOR VARIABLES FOR PARTITIONING HABITATS AMONG THE THREE GENERA.

THIS WORK INVESTIGATES CONTRASTING DEPOSITIONAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL PATTERNS IN THE ABROLHOS SHELF-SLOPE SYSTEM, EASTERN BRAZILIAN MARGIN, SOUTH ATLANTIC. WE HAVE COMBINED EXISTING BATHYMETRIC DATASETS WITH BOTTOM IMAGERY AND SAMPLES COLLECTED AT THE JOHNSON-SEA-LINK MANNED SUBMERSIBLE ALONG TWO ABROLHOS SLOPE SITES, WHICH ARE SEPARATED BY ALMOST 2 DEGREES OF LATITUDE. OUR DATASET INCLUDES SEAFLOOR SEDIMENTS, SINGLE-BEAM ECHOSOUNDER, AND 20H OF VIDEO RECORDING. DIVES RANGED FROM 90 TO 620M WATER DEPTH. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NORTH AND SOUTH ABROLHOS SHELF-SLOPE SYSTEMS ARE DISTINCT IN TERMS OF THEIR MORPHOLOGY AND SEDIMENTOLOGY. THE DEPOSITIONAL PATTERN IN THE NORTHERN UPPER SLOPE IS TYPICALLY CARBONATE DOMINATED, WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF CARBONATE MOUNDS AROUND 500M DEEP, SMALL BIOGENIC STRUCTURES AROUND 200M DEEP, INTERSPERSED WITH WACKSTONES AND PACKSTONES. THE UPPER SLOPE IS CHARACTERIZED BY A STEEP LIMESTONE WALL AT 120M DEEP THAT RESEMBLES A SHELF-EDGE REEF, FOLLOWED BY EXTENSIVE RHODOLITH BEDS AT THE SHELF EDGE AND OUTER SHELF. THE SOUTHERN UPPER SLOPE SHOWS A SIGMOIDAL PROFILE WITH A GENTLE GRADIENT. MIXED SILICICLASTIC-CARBONATE FINE SEDIMENTATION DOMINATES FROM 300 TO 700M DEEP. ON THE UPPER SLOPE, FINE CARBONATE SEDIMENTATION PREDOMINATES, AND A BIOGENIC REEF STRUCTURE IS OBSERVED IN A WATER DEPTH AROUND 120-130M. THE SHELF EDGE AND OUTER SHELF ARE ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY EXTENSIVE RHODOLITH BEDS.

USING ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY, WE EXAMINED THE SIZE AT WHICH NASSAU GROUPER MIGRATE TO SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS, THE TIMING OF MIGRATIONS, AND THE DISTANCE OF MIGRATION ROUTES USED BY NASSAU GROUPER FROM WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF A LARGE, NO-TAKE MARINE RESERVE IN THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. FISH (TOTAL N = 19) WERE TAGGED IN 2004 (N = 6) AND 2005 (N = 13) AND WERE TRACKED FOR ONE TO FOUR SPAWNING SEASONS. FISH THAT WERE 54 CM TL OR GREATER MADE SPAWNING MIGRATIONS, WITH ALL BUT ONE MIGRATING SOUTHWARD ALONG THE SHELF EDGE OF EXUMA SOUND FOR A DISTANCE OF 70 KM TO OVER 200 KM, USUALLY DURING THE DECEMBER FULL MOON. FISH TYPICALLY MADE ONE MIGRATION ANNUALLY, WHICH LASTED FROM 1 TO 3 WEEKS, WITH FISH REMAINING AT SPAWNING SITES FOR ONLY 1-2 D HOWEVER, WHEN THE FULL MOON WAS EARLY IN THE SPAWNING SEASON, SEVERAL FISH REMAINED AWAY FROM THEIR HOME REEFS THROUGH TWO LUNAR CYCLES OR DELAYED THEIR MIGRATIONS BY A MONTH, AND ONE FISH MADE TWO MIGRATIONS. FISH THAT WERE MIGRATING FOR THE FIRST TIME HAD SLOWER SWIMMING SPEEDS TO SPAWNING SITES THAN DID EXPERIENCED FISH, BUT SWIMMING SPEEDS WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS DURING RETURN MIGRATIONS, SUGGESTING THAT THEIR MIGRATION BEHAVIOR WAS LEARNED. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT SPAWNING MIGRATION PATTERNS FOR THIS SPECIES MAY BE MORE VARIABLE IN THE BAHAMAS THAN AT OTHER CARIBBEAN LOCATIONS.

DENNIS GD,1988,BULL MAR SCI,REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES ON HARD BANKS IN THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO,NA,"SCUBA diver and submersible observations were used to characterize tropical reef fish assemblages on the hard banks of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, which have been relatively unstudied due to their remoteness and depth. Four assemblages were distinguishable: coral reef, mid-shelf, algal-sponge, and drowned reef zones in the order of their species richness. These tropical communities are limited to the intermediate and outer shelf by winter cooling of inner shelf waters and high turbidity associated with discharge of the Mississippi/Atchafalaya and other rivers. These communities exhibit seasonal stability and annual persistence over the length of the study (ca. 10 yrs).

High reef fish diversity at the Flower Garden banks is due to the variety of habitats and insular environmental conditions. Some Caribbean species are not established in the northwestern Gulf due to the lack of habitat diversity rather than temperature tolerance.

Similarities in reef fish species composition on widely scattered banks is due to similar crest depths and hydrographic conditions which result in similar epibenthic communities. The nepheloid layer was the most important environmental factor in determining composition of reef fish assemblages, by producing low species richness and abundance. Limited food resources may also play a role in determining reef fish abundance and species composition on deeper reefs. The scarcity of hard substrate and the presence of the nepheloid layer combine to limit the distribution and abundance of tropical reef fish in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.

Species composition of tropical reef fish assemblages indicate an ecotone between western Atlantic continental and insular tropical faunas in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.",NA,DENNIS GD_1988_BULL MAR SCI,,,,,,,

LOCATION: EGMONT ATOLL, CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO, CENTRAL INDIAN OCEAN. TIME PERIOD: PRESENT. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: MARINE BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES, PLANTS. METHODS: USING A REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE, WE COLLECTED VIDEO TRANSECTS BETWEEN 15 AND 160 M. WE ANALYSED THE DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION OF BENTHIC COMMUNITIES AND USED DISTLM ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OVER THE DEPTH GRADIENT AND BETWEEN SITES. RESULTS: WE OBSERVED DISTINCT BENTHIC COMMUNITIES ALONG THE DEPTH GRADIENT, WITH A STRONG COMMUNITY BREAK OBSERVED AT SIMILAR TO 60 M. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED A CLEAR ZONATION OF THE BENTHIC TAXA WITH DEPTH. THIS ZONATION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOWNWARD IRRADIANCE AND TEMPERATURE, WITH ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES PLAYING A MINOR ROLE IN STRUCTURING THE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: WE SHOW THAT MCES IN THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO ARE DISTINCT COMMUNITIES, AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY IRRADIANCE AND TEMPERATURE. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE VARIABILITY IN BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF MCES, BOTH ALONG THE DEPTH GRADIENT AND AT LOCAL GEOGRAPHICAL SCALES FOR THE STUDY REGION.

THE EASTWARD EXTENSION OF THE SPG AT 2.8 KA IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER C-14 RESERVOIR AGE (200 YRS) COMPARED TO PERIODS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER CONTRIBUTION OF STG WATERS. THIS INDICATES THAT C-14 RESERVOIR AGES ARE MAINLY A FUNCTION OF VERTICAL MIXING OF THE SUB-SURFACE OF THE OCEAN. AS STRONGER VERTICAL VENTILATION IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF LOCAL RADIOGENIC SURFACE WATER, WE HYPOTHESIZE IT COULD REPRESENT VERTICAL VENTILATION IN THE NORTH-EASTERN ATLANTIC.

HOWEVER, KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMPOSITION OF MCES AND HOW THEY VARY IN SPACE IS LACKING IN MANY REGIONS, PARTICULARLY THE CORAL TRIANGLE BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT. HERE, WE COMPARED THE BENTHIC COMPONENTS AND CORAL GENERA COMPOSITION BETWEEN SHALLOW-WATER REEFS (SWRS, 8-13M DEPTH) AND UPPER MCES (30-40 M) IN FOUR LOCATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES THAT ARE EXPOSED TO DIFFERING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. CORAL COVER, ABUNDANCE, AND GENERIC DIVERSITY WERE LOWER IN MCES THAN SWRS AT THREE OF THE FOUR LOCATIONS. BENTHIC COMPOSITION AND CORAL GENERIC COMPOSITION ALSO VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG LOCATIONS FOR BOTH SHALLOW AND DEEP SITES. DIFFERENCES IN BENTHIC COMPOSITION AMONG SITES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO VARIATION IN HARD CORALS, MACROALGAE, SAND AND SILT, WHILE VARIATION IN CORAL ASSEMBLAGE WAS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE OF ENCRUSTING PORITES, BRANCHING ACROPORA, BRANCHING SERIATOPORA. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE COMPOSITION OF MCE COMMUNITIES VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ADJACENT SHALLOW REEFS, BUT ALSO AMONG MCES IN DIFFERING GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. FURTHERMORE, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST DISTURBANCES AFFECTING SHALLOW-WATER REEFS, PARTICULARLY SEDIMENTATION, ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT MCES, AND THAT DEPTH THEREFORE PROVIDES NO POTENTIAL REFUGE FROM THESE DISTURBANCES. WE RECOMMEND THAT CONSERVATION OF MCES CONSIDER SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AMONG SITES, AND URGE FURTHER RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE COMPOSITION OF MCE COMMUNITIES IN THE PHILIPPINES.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.104772,DUMALAGAN JR EE_2019_MAR ENVIRON RES,,,,,,,

HOWEVER, A LARGE KNOWLEDGE GAP EXISTS ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF BENTHIC COMMUNITIES EXTENDING INTO THE SO-CALLED MESOPHOTIC OR TWILIGHT DEPTH RANGE, CURRENTLY UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE FROM COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHING. A SERIES OF VISUAL SURVEYS, CARRIED OUT BY MEANS OF REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES BETWEEN 2012 AND 2018, WERE CONDUCTED ALONG THE LIGURIAN DEEP CONTINENTAL SHELF AND SHELF BREAK, BETWEEN 30 AND 210 M DEPTH, IN ORDER TO CHARACTERIZE THE MAIN BENTHIC BIOCOENOSES DWELLING AT THIS DEPTH RANGE AND TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN THEIR SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION. DEEP CIRCALITTORAL COMMUNITIES OF THE LIGURIAN SEA WERE REPRESENTED BY A MIXTURE OF SPECIES BELONGING TO THE DEEPEST EXTENSION OF SHALLOW-WATER HABITATS AND DEEP CIRCALITTORAL ONES. TWELVE MAJOR BIOCOENOSES WERE IDENTIFIED, EACH ONE CHARACTERIZED BY SPECIFIC PREFERENCES IN DEPTH RANGE, SUBSTRATE TYPE AND SEABED SLOPE.

WE PRESENT AN ANALYSIS OF THE BIOLOGICAL AND SEDIMENTARY COMPOSITION OF THE REEFS THAT BUILDS DIRECTLY ON RECENTLY PUBLISHED CHRONOLOGICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL DATA. WE DEFINE NINE DISTINCT LIMESTONE FACIES AND PLACE THEM IN A SPATIAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC CONTEXT WITHIN 12 REEF TERRACES USING ROV AND SUBMERSIBLE OBSERVATIONS. THESE INCLUDE OOLITIC, TWO CORAL REEF, TWO CORALLINE ALGAL NODULE, ALGAL CRUST, HEMI-PELAGIC MUD, BIOCLASTIC AND PELOIDAL MUD FACIES. THESE FACIES CHARACTERISE ENVIRONMENTS FROM HIGH ENERGY SHALLOW WATER CORAL REEF CRESTS TO LOW ENERGY NON-REEFAL DEEP-WATER SETTINGS. COMBINING THE BOTTOM OBSERVATIONS AND SEDIMENTARY FACIES DATA, WE REPORT A SHIFT IN THE OBSERVED SEDIMENTARY FACIES ACROSS THE SUBMERGED REEFS OF THE MNC FROM DOMINANT SHALLOW CORAL REEF FACIES ON THE DEEP REEFS TO CORALLINE ALGAE DOMINATED EXPOSED OUTCROP MORPHOLOGY ON THE SHALLOWER REEFS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS SHIFT IS A REFLECTION OF THE CHANGE IN PERIOD AND AMPLITUDE OF GLACIOEUSTATIC SEA LEVEL CYCLES (41 KYR AND 60-70 M TO 100 KYR AND 120 M) DURING THE MID-PLEISTOCENE TRANSITION (MPT, SIMILAR TO 800 KA), COUPLED WITH A SLOWING IN THE SUBSIDENCE RATE OF THE COMPLEX. THE GROWTH OF STRATIGRAPHICALLY THICK CORAL REEF UNITS ON THE DEEP PRE-MPT REEFS WAS DUE TO THE RAPID SUBSIDENCE OF THE SUBSTRATE AND THE SHORTER, SMALLER AMPLITUDE SEA LEVEL CYCLES ALLOWING RE-OCCUPATION AND CORAL GROWTH ON SUCCESSIVE CYCLE LOW-STANDS. LONGER, LARGER AMPLITUDE SEA LEVEL CYCLES AFTER THE MPT COMBINED WITH GREATER VERTICAL STABILITY AT THIS TIME PRODUCED CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO DEEP-WATER CORALLINE ALGAE GROWTH WHICH VENEERED THE SHALLOWER TERRACES.

THE INCENTIVE FOR THE PRESENT STUDY WAS: (1) THE RECENT ACCELERATED GLOBAL DEGRADATION OF CORAL REEFS; (2) THE GROWING INTEREST IN MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS (MCES; 30-120 M DEPTH) AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO SERVE AS A LARVAL SOURCE FOR SHALLOW REEFS; AND (3) THE LACK OF INFORMATION ON MCE CORAL REPRODUCTION. HERE, WE COMPARE THE REPRODUCTION AND ECOLOGY OF THE DEPTH-GENERALIST CORAL PARAMONTASTRAEA PERESI BETWEEN SHALLOW (5-10 M) AND MESOPHOTIC (40-45 M) HABITATS IN THE GULF OF EILAT/AQABA, RED SEA. FIELD SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE LIVING COVER, ABUNDANCE, AND SIZE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF P. PERESI. FOUR TO SIX COLONIES FROM EACH HABITAT WERE SAMPLED MONTHLY BETWEEN APRIL 2015 AND JANUARY 2017, AND THE GAMETOGENESIS CYCLES, FECUNDITY, AND OOCYTE SIZES WERE MEASURED. THE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE IN THE MCES WAS SHORTER THAN IN THE SHALLOW REEF. DESPITE HAVING LARGER POLYPS, THE MESOPHOTIC COLONIES CONTAINED SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER AND FEWER OOCYTES PER POLYP. IN SPITE OF THE RELATIVELY STABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF THE MCES, WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CORAL SURVIVAL, SCARCITY OF SUNLIGHT IS PROBABLY A MAJOR ENERGETIC IMPEDIMENT TO INVESTMENT IN REPRODUCTION BY P. PERESI AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. FURTHER INTENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE STUDIES IN MESOPHOTIC REEFS ARE THUS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF CORALS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT TO REPRODUCE AND CONSTITUTE A LARVAL SOURCE FOR DEPLETED SHALLOW-WATER REEFS.",10.1007/s00338-017-1648-8,FELDMAN B_2018_CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,

THE ROCKS AND SEDIMENTS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SEVEN SEDIMENTARY FACIES: BINDSTONES DOMINATED BY CORALLINE ALGAL CRUSTS, BINDSTONES DOMINATED BY FORAMINIFERAL CRUSTS, BINDSTONES DOMINATED BY BRYOZOAN CRUSTS, CORAL FRAMESTONES, BINDSTONES AND INTERSTRATIFIED PACKSTONES RICH IN SKELETAL DEBRIS, PACKSTONES/WACKESTONES AND GRAINSTONES RICH IN ROCK GRAVELS. RADIOCARBON DATING PERFORMED ON ENCRUSTING ORGANISMS (CORALLINE ALGAE AND ACERVULMIDS) AND CORALS PROVIDE AGES RELATIVELY YOUNG. THESE AGES CONFIRM THAT THE ENCRUSTING ORGANISMS ARE MODEM AND THE CORALS MAINLY DATED OF HOLOCENE ARE REWORKED DUE TO THE INSTABILITY OF THE FORE-REEF SLOPES, ESPECIALLY DURING STORMS. BECAUSE THE BIOLOGICAL ASSEMBLAGES ARE DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO A BATHYMETRIC RANGE DEPENDING ON LIGHT INTENSITY, A MODEL OF DISTRIBUTION OF MODEM ENCRUSTING CALCAREOUS ORGANISMS CAN BE PROPOSED FROM OUR OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSES. FROM THE UPPER REEF SLOPES TO APPROXIMATELY 90 IN, THICK CORALLINE ALGAL CRUSTS ARE DOMINANT AND DISTRIBUTED IN THREE GROUPS.

THE CPUE ANALYSIS FOR BOTH SPECIES ALLOWED THE IDENTIFICATION OF OUTLIERS AND FAR OUTLIERS, REPRESENTING FISHERIES WITH EXCEPTIONAL CATCHES, WHICH WERE USED AS PROXIES OF POSSIBLE AGGREGATION. THE PRESENCE OF PRE-SPAWNING AND RECENT SPAWNING SIGNS (HYDRATED OOCYTES AND POST-OVULATORY FOLLICLES) IN THE OVARY OF FEMALES CAUGHT AT SITES WITH RECURRENT RECORDS OF HIGH CPUE ALLOWED THE VALIDATION OF SPAWNING ACTIVITY AT THOSE SPECIFIC SITES FOR EACH SPECIES. ALL AGGREGATION SITES IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY WERE LOCATED ON THE OUTER SHELF, CLOSE TO THE SHELF BREAK, A REGION THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED AN ECOLOGICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY SIGNIFICANT MARINE AREA.

BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES AT THESE AREAS, AS WELL AS FISH ASSEMBLAGES ON UNPROTECTED DEEPER REEFS (25-35 M), WERE MONITORED FROM 2003 ONWARDS. 3. HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS STRONGLY INFLUENCED FISH ASSEMBLAGES' STRUCTURE. THIS, TOGETHER WITH THE LACK OF DATA FROM BEFORE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MPAS, DID NOT ALLOW AN UNEQUIVOCAL ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF THE MPAS. 4. BIOMASS OF COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT FISH, PARTICULARLY SMALL CARNIVORES, WAS HIGHER IN THE OLDER NTR. BIOMASS OF BLACK GROUPER MYCTEROPERCA BONACI INCREASED BY 30-FOLD INSIDE NTRS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, WHILE REMAINING CONSISTENTLY LOW ELSEWHERE. 5. A SINGLE HERBIVORE SPECIES, THE PARROTFISH SCARUS TRISPINOSUS, DOMINATED FISH ASSEMBLAGES (28.3\% OF TOTAL BIOMASS). BIOMASS OF THIS SPECIES INCREASED IN 2002 ON THE YOUNGER NTR AND ON THE MUA, SOON AFTER ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FORMER AND BANNING OF THE PARROTFISH FISHERY IN THE LATTER. THIS INCREASE WAS FOLLOWED BY A DECLINE FROM 2003 ONWARDS, AFTER INCREASED POACHING AND REOPENING OF THE PARROTFISH FISHERY. 6. FISH BIOMASS INCREASED IN 2002 ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION. THIS INCREASE WAS STRONGER IN SITES CLOSER TO DEEPER REEFS, WHERE FISH BIOMASS WAS UP TO 30-TIMES HIGHER THAN SHALLOW REEFS: MOVEMENT OF FISH FROM DEEPER TO SHALLOWER AREAS MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE. 7.

THE PRESENT STUDY UTILISES DATA ON FISH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OBTAINED FROM 1546 BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO DEPLOYMENTS CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2004 - 2019 IN DEPTHS OF 9 - 170 M ACROSS 2000 KM OF COASTLINE IN NORTH-WEST AUSTRALIA ON NATURAL HABITATS AND SUBSEA PIPELINES TO UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE OF OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE ON FISH ASSEMBLAGES. A TOTAL OF 450 FISH TAXA FROM 56 FAMILIES WAS OBSERVED, WITH POPULATIONS DOMINATED BY GENERALIST AND INVERTEBRATE CARNIVORE TAXA. AT THE REGIONAL SCALE, SUBSEA PIPELINES HAD LOWER DIVERSITY (LOWER TAXONOMIC RICHNESS) THAN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS, BUT POSSESSED A HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF PISCIVOROUS AND HERBIVOROUS FISH TAXA. CLEAR PATTERNS IN FISH ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION WERE OBSERVED IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES, REFLECTING THE PROXIMITY OF OCEANIC SHOALS AND BANKS, DEPTH, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. SHALLOW-WATER AND CLOSE TO SHOALS ASSEMBLAGES WERE CHARACTERISED BY A DIVERSITY OF SITE-ATTACHED (E.G., WRASSES, TUSKFISH), REEF-ASSOCIATED TAXA (E.G., EMPERORS). MESOPHOTIC FISH ASSEMBLAGES WERE CHARACTERISED BY COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT (E.G., GOLDBAND SNAPPER), WIDE-RANGING (E.G., SHARKS) AND SAND-AFFILIATED (E.G., TOADFISH, THREADFIN BREAM) TAXA. PROXIMITY TO PIPELINES AND PLATFORMS RANKED LOW AS PREDICTORS IN THE MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES SUGGESTING A NEGLIGIBLE REGIONAL INFLUENCE OF THESE STRUCTURES ON FISH COMMUNITIES IN COMPARISON TO DEPTH AND SHOAL HABITATS.

A CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS ARISING FROM STUDIES OF THESE SYSTEMS IS THE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF SEAMOUNTS AS STEPPING-STONES FOR DISPERSAL AND POPULATION CONNECTIVITY. EVIDENCE OF THIS MECHANISM EXISTS FOR A RANGE OF TAXA, INCLUDING CORAL REEF FISHES, BUT IS STILL LACKING FROM MANY TROPICAL SEAMOUNTS IN REMOTE REGIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES AND BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO SYSTEMS TO SURVEY FISH AND BENTHIC COMMUNITIES BETWEEN 1 AND 100 M ON SEAMOUNTS IN THE CORAL SEA MARINE PARK (CSMP), AUSTRALIA. WE FOUND EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE STEPPING-STONE MODEL OF ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY FROM NEW OBSERVATIONS OF 16 CORAL REEF FISHES WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOT BEEN RECORDED BY QUANTITATIVE SURVEYS IN THE REGION. THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF MANY OF THESE SPECIES THROUGHOUT THE FULL LATITUDINAL EXTENT OF THE CSMP SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS GREATER CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MESOPHOTIC HABITATS IN THE CORAL SEA AND SURROUNDING BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN. WE ALSO FOUND A WIDE VARIETY OF MESOPHOTIC HABITATS AND RECORDED SIGNIFICANT DEPTH RANGE EXTENSIONS FOR 78 FISHES IN THESE HABITATS. THIS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF INCREASED HABITAT AREA AND HETEROGENEITY IN A STEPPING-STONE EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE REGION. FOUR OF THE FISH OCCURRENCE RECORDS REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT RANGE EXTENSIONS INTO THE CORAL SEA FROM ADJACENT BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, AND 13 FISHES RECORDED BY THIS STUDY IN THE CSMP ARE NOT KNOWN FROM THE NEIGHBOURING GREAT BARRIER REEF, DESPITE ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY. ALTHOUGH THE CORAL SEA REMAINS RELATIVELY UNDERSTUDIED, THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT LARGER-SCALE MODELS OF MARINE BIOGEOGRAPHY ARE RELEVANT TO COMMUNITIES IN THE REGION, PARTICULARLY AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. GIVEN THE EXTENT AND THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF SEAMOUNTS IN THE CORAL SEA, OUR FINDINGS EMPHASISE THAT THE REGION IS AN IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN THE CENTRE OF MARINE BIODIVERSITY IN THE CORAL TRIANGLE AND THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC.

IT IS SUFFICIENTLY ISOLATED (THE CLOSEST ISLAND LIES 520 KIN NORTHWEST OF RAPA) TO BE REGARDED AS A SEPARATE GEOGRAPHIC UNIT. IN 2002, AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF SCIENTISTS CONDUCTED A MARINE BIODIVERSITY SURVEY OF RAPA (ALGAE, CORALS, FISHES AND MOLLUSCS). THE PRESENT STUDY PRESENTS THE DIVERSITY OF FISH, WITH TWO OBJECTIVES: I) ESTABLISH THE CHECKLIST OF CORAL REEF FISH SPECIES PRESENT AT RAPA, AND II) STUDY THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL REEF FISH COMMUNITIES. IN 1990, RANDALL, SMITH AND FEINBERG PUBLISHED A LIST INCLUDING 274 CORAL REEF FISH SPECIES AT RAPA. DURING OUR EXPEDITION AT RAPA, FISH SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED TO SAMPLE SPECIMENS AT 66 COLLECTING STATIONS FROM 0 TO 78 IN OF DEPTH BY VISUAL SURVEY AND/OR CAPTURE WITH THE ICHTHYOCIDE ROTENONE AND BY SPEARING. COMBINING THESE FISH RECORDS WITH THE LIST OF RANDALL ET AL. BRINGS THE NUMBER OF CORAL REEF FISH SPECIES KNOWN FROM RAPA TO OVER 383 SPECIES. THE RAPAN FISH FAUNA IS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ALREADY RECORDED IN FRENCH POLYNESIA. SOME SHALLOW-WATER FAMILIES OR GENUS, OF WHICH THERE ARE WIDE-RANGING SPECIES IN FRENCH POLYNESIA, WERE NOT FOUND AT RAPA: CLUPEIDAE, CARAPIDAE, PSEUDOCHROMIDAE, MALACANTHIDAE, MUGILOIDIDAE, SOLEIDAE, SCORPAENOPSIS AND PSEUDANTHIAS. MOREOVER, 10\% OF SPECIES ARE CURRENTLY KNOWN ONLY FROM RAPA. VISUAL SURVEYS OF CORAL REEF FISHES WERE CONDUCTED AT VARIOUS STATIONS AROUND RAPA. SPATIAL VARIATION IN FISH COMMUNITIES WAS COMPARED TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES (WATER DEPTH: 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, AND 24 IN; REEF ZONE: BAY VS. OUTER SLOPE; EXPOSITION TO THE SWELL: NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, AND EAST). THE TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF CORAL REEF FISHES AT RAPA WAS LOW (108 SPECIES RECORDED ON 60 TRANSECTS OF 100 M(2)). MEAN ABUNDANCE OF REEF FISHES WAS ALSO LOW (1.81 +/- 0.29 SE FISH PER M(2)), WITH MORE THAN 49\% OF ALL FISHES BELONGING TO THE FAMILY POMACENTRIDAE AND 31\% TO SCARIDAE. THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF FISH WAS CHARACTERIZED BY FOUR COMMUNITIES. IN THE BAY, THE FISH COMMUNITY WAS DOMINATED BY THE POMACENTRIDAE (72.7\%) WITH CHROMIS ATRIPECTORALIS AND DASCYLLUS ARITANUS AS THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES. IN CONTRAST, THE DEEP REEF SLOPE COMMUNITY (>= 12 M) FROM NORTH TO SOUTH-WESTERN COAST WAS CHARACTERISED BY HIGH DENSITIES OF THE POMACENTRID CHRYSIPTERA LEUCOPOMA, AS WELL AS HIGH DENSITIES OF THE ACANTHURID ACANTHITRUS LELICOPAREIUS. THE SECOND DEEP REEF SLOPE COMMUNITY ENCOUNTERED ON SOUTH-EAST TO EAST COAST WAS CHARACTERISED BY HIGH DENSITIES OF SCARIDAE (64.1\%), MAINLY SCARUS PSITTACUS AND S. SCHLEGELI. LASTLY, THE SHALLOW REEF SLOPE COMMUNITY (< 12 M) WAS DOMINATED AT 51.3\% BY POMACENTRIDAE (CHROMIS ATRIPECTORALIS) AND AT 34.1\% BY SCARIDAE (SCARUS PSITTACUS AND S.

AMONG THE SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES DERIVED FROM MULTIBEAM DATA, SLOPE, RUGOSITY, EASTNESS AND DISTANCE TO ROCKS, APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN VARIABLES INVOLVED IN S.

SAVAGLIA ECOLOGICAL NICHE IS SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWER THAN THE AVAILABLE HABITAT. THE HS MAP WAS DEVELOPED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE SEA FLOOR INTO SUITABILITY CLASSES. THE COMPARISON BETWEEN SUITABILITY CLASSES AND PRESENCE DATA SHOWED THAT THE HS MAP IS COHERENT WITH THE OBSERVED SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES. THE MOST SUITABLE HABITAT FOR S. SAVAGLIA IS CHARACTERIZED BY A ROUGH SEA FLOOR WITH ROCKS THAT IS STEEPLY SLOPED, ORIENTED NORTHEAST, AND WITHIN A WATER DEPTH RANGE OF 34-77 M.

HOWEVER, ALMOST NO DATA EXIST REGARDING THEIR ASSOCIATED MACROFAUNA. THE CURRENT STUDY SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY THE MACROFAUNA ASSOCIATED WITH MASSIVE SPONGES ALONG THE ISRAELI MEDITERRANEAN COAST; AND TO COMPARE THE ROLE OF SPONGES, AS ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS, OR ``LIVING HOTELS,'' IN BOTH THE SHALLOW-WATER AND MESOPHOTIC HABITATS. SIXTY-FOUR MASSIVE SPONGE SPECIMENS, FROM 10 DIFFERENT SPECIES, WERE COLLECTED FROM SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC HABITATS BY SCUBA DIVING AND REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE, RESPECTIVELY. SPONGE VOLUME WAS ESTIMATED, SPECIMENS WERE DISSECTED, AND THE ASSOCIATED MACROFAUNA WERE IDENTIFIED. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE SPONGES SUPPORTED A DIVERSE ASSEMBLAGE OF ASSOCIATED MACROFAUNA. A TOTAL OF 61 ASSOCIATED TAXA WERE FOUND, INCLUDING SPECIES REPORTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ISRAEL. A CLEAR, DIFFERENTIATION EXISTED IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSEMBLAGE BETWEEN THE TWO HABITATS, WHICH IS MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO FOUR SPECIES (TWO POLYCHAETES, A CRUSTACEAN, AND A BRITTLE STAR). THE TROPHIC COMPOSITION REMAINED STABLE ACROSS THE TWO HABITATS. NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN SPONGE VOLUME AND THE ASSOCIATED FAUNA COMMUNITY PARAMETERS. THE HIGHEST RICHNESS OF ASSOCIATED FAUNA WAS FOUND IN THE MESOPHOTIC HABITAT, WHERE SPONGE DIVERSITY IS ALSO HIGHER. IN CONTRAST, A GREATER ENDOBIONT ABUNDANCE AND DENSITY WERE RECORDED IN THE SHALLOW HABITAT, WHERE MASSIVE SPONGES MAY BE A LIMITING FACTOR DUE TO THEIR LOWER RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE.

The new DCRMP sample domain (>30 to 50 m) encompassed 2.4 times more survey area than NCRMP (0 to ≤30 m) and collected high quality data (CV <20%) on coral reef fishes [three survey years, 29 (5) species; mean (standard deviation)]. For the four representative, fishery-targeted, analysis species selected (i. e., grouper, snapper, triggerfish, and parrotfish), domain-wide density and length comparisons between surveys showed similar or statistically higher abundances and larger lengths for fishes at deeper depths (>30 to 50 m). These results highlight the importance of surveying the entire insular shelf in St. Thomas and St. John, US Virgin Islands for fisheries management applications. Furthermore, the DCRMP survey leveraged NCRMP's methods and resources resulting in a seamless extension to deeper waters. However, if these programs were fully integrated and optimized within a single survey design, approximately half the sites would be needed to achieve the same level of precision, offering substantial time and cost savings. The principles of probabilistic sampling successfully used in the present fishery-independent survey design (0 to 50 m) can be applied more broadly to develop an ""ideal"" large-scale, multi-gear survey from 0 to about 500 m to encompass the entire depth ranges of managed species in the US Caribbean.",10.5343/bms.2023.0013,GROVE LJW_2024_BULL MAR SCI,,,,,,,

IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL HEATWAVE EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED IN MULTIPLE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC OCEAN. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED OCEAN TEMPERATURES ON COLD-WATER CORALS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. DETERMINING THE UPPER THERMAL LIMITS OF COLD-WATER OCTOCORALS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN IDENTIFYING IF WARM-WATER EVENTS POSE A POTENTIAL THREAT.

HOWEVER, DURING THERMAL ANOMALIES, DESPITE A TIME LAG IN WARM SURFACE WATERS REACHING MESOPHOTIC REEFS, THERE WAS ULTIMATELY A 1.0 DEGREES C INCREASE IN WATER TEMPERATURE AT BOTH 8 AND 50 M, PUSHING TEMPERATURES OVER BLEACHING THRESHOLDS AT BOTH DEPTHS. AS SUCH, ANEMONE BLEACHING WAS OBSERVED IN MESOPHOTIC REEFS DURING THESE THERMAL ANOMALIES, BUT WAS BUFFERED COMPARED TO THE PERCENTAGE OF BLEACHING IN SHALLOWER WATERS, WHICH WAS NEARLY FIVE TIMES GREATER.

WE TESTED THE EFFICACY OF WOODEN SLAT LOBSTER TRAPS, WIRE SEA BASS TRAPS, AND EXPERIMENTAL NON-CONTAINMENT GITTINGS TRAPS. ONE HUNDRED DEPLOYMENTS OF EACH TRAP TYPE WERE MADE AT 120 MESOPHOTIC (38-78 M DEEP) NATURAL REEF SITES IN THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO (29.6-30.1 DEGREES N, 86.1-87.6 DEGREES W). REEF SITES WERE SURVEYED WITH REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES (ROV) BEFORE AND AFTER TRAP DEPLOYMENTS, AND REMOTE TIME-LAPSE VIDEO CAMERAS WERE AFFIXED ABOVE 86 TRAPS TO SAMPLE IN SITU RECRUITMENT TO THE TRAPS. THE VIDEO DATA SHOWED THAT LIONFISH WERE ATTRACTED TO THE VICINITY OF THE THREE TRAP TYPES AT SIMILAR RATES, BUT THAT LIONFISH RARELY ENTERED THE LOBSTER OR SEA BASS TRAPS. THE HIGH BYCATCH RATES OF SEA BASS TRAPS SUGGESTED THEIR USE IS LIKELY UNSUITABLE FOR TARGETING LIONFISH. LOBSTER TRAPS HAD LOWER RATES OF BYCATCH, BUT THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH RATIO OF BYCATCH-TO-LIONFISH CATCHES SUGGESTS THAT MODIFICATIONS WILL BE NEEDED TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFICIENT. THE GITTINGS TRAPS HAD THE HIGHEST LIONFISH CATCH RATES AND LOWEST BYCATCHES OF NATIVE FISHES, BUT OPERATIONAL ISSUES WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. THEY FAILED TO OPEN ON 20\% OF DEPLOYMENTS AND ONE ENTANGLED A GREEN SEA TURTLE (CHELONIA MYDAS). EVEN WITH THE BEST-PERFORMING TRAP DESIGN, THE AVERAGE CATCH RATE OF LIONFISH WAS LESS THAN ONE LIONFISH PER TRAP. A POTENTIAL EXPLANATION COULD BE THE LOW BIOMASS OF LIONFISH OBSERVED DURING THE ROV SURVEYS, WHICH AVERAGED 0.3 KG LIONFISH PER SITE. THE TIME-LAPSE VIDEO DATA SUGGESTED THAT LIONFISH RECRUITMENT TO GITTINGS TRAPS COULD INCREASE WITH HIGHER DENSITIES OF LIONFISH ON THE NEARBY REEFS, IF TRAPS WERE RETRIEVED AFTER APPROXIMATELY TWO DAYS OF DEPLOYMENT, AND IF TRAPS WERE RETRIEVED DURING DAWN OR DUSK.

THE BIOT MPA CONSISTS OF THE ATOLLS OF THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO, INTERSPERSED WITH AND SURROUNDED BY DEEP OCEANIC WATERS. ISLANDS AROUND THE ATOLL RIMS SERVE AS NESTING GROUNDS FOR SEA BIRDS. EXTENSIVE AND DIVERSE SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC REEF HABITATS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL HABITAT AND FEEDING GROUNDS FOR ALL MARINE LIFE, AND THE ABSENCE OF LOCAL HUMAN IMPACTS MAY IMPROVE RECOVERY AFTER CORAL BLEACHING EVENTS. CENSUS DATA HAVE SHOWN RECENT INCREASES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF SEA TURTLES, HIGH NUMBERS OF NESTING SEABIRDS AND HIGH FISH ABUNDANCE, AT LEAST SOME OF WHICH IS LINKED TO THE LACK OF RECENT HARVESTING. FOR EXAMPLE, ACROSS THE ARCHIPELAGO THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF GREEN TURTLE CLUTCHES (CHELONIA MYDAS) IS SIMILAR TO 20,500 AND INCREASING AND THE NUMBER OF SEABIRDS IS SIMILAR TO 1 MILLION. ANIMAL TRACKING STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SOME TAXA BREED AND/OR FORAGE CONSISTENTLY WITHIN THE MPA (E.G. SOME REEF FISHES, ELASMOBRANCHS AND SEABIRDS), SUGGESTING THE MPA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM PROTECTION. IN CONTRAST, POST-NESTING GREEN TURTLES TRAVEL UP TO 4000 KM TO DISTANT FORAGING SITES, SO THE PROTECTED BEACHES IN THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO PROVIDE A NESTING SANCTUARY FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT FORAGE ACROSS AN OCEAN BASIN AND SEVERAL GEOPOLITICAL BORDERS.

THE TEN MOST SPECIES-RICH FAMILIES ACCOUNTED FOR 58\% OF THE COMMUNITY AND INCLUDED: LABRIDAE (13\%), POMACENTRIDAE (8\%), EPINEPHELIDAE (6\%), ACANTHURIDAE (5\%), CHAETODONTIDAE (5\%), MURAENIDAE (5\%), GOBIIDAE (5\%), BLENNIIDAE (4\%), APOGONIDAE (4\%) AND SCORPAENIDAE (3\%). THE MAJORITY (89\%) OF SPECIES INHABIT SHALLOW CORAL REEFS, WITH DEEP REEFS (60-300 M) AND PELAGIC WATERS ONLY ACCOUNTING FOR 7\% AND 2\% OF FISH COMMUNITY. APPROXIMATELY 76\% OF THE FISHES ARE WIDESPREAD INDO-PACIFIC SPECIES, 12\% ARE PACIFIC OCEAN SPECIES, 5\% ARE CIRCUMTROPICAL, 4\% ARE INDIAN OCEAN SPECIES AND APPROXIMATELY 1\% ARE ENDEMIC. ABUNDANCE SURVEYS REVEALED THAT ENDEMIC SPECIES, AND SPECIES AT THE EDGE OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC RANGE, DO NOT CONFORM TO TERRESTRIAL-BASED PREDICTIONS OF LOW ABUNDANCE. THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE CHRISTMAS ISLAND FISH COMMUNITY IS INFLUENCED BY THREE MAIN FACTORS. FIRSTLY, THE ISOLATION OF THE ISLAND MEANS THAT FISHES WITH POOR DISPERSAL ABILITIES (E.G., SYNGNATHIDS) ARE UNDERREPRESENTED. SECONDLY, THE BIOGEOGRAPHIC POSITION OF THE ISLAND RESULTS IN A UNIQUE MIXING OF INDIAN AND PACIFIC OCEAN SPECIES. THIRDLY, THE LACK OF LAGOONAL HABITATS MEANS THAT FISHES THAT USE THESE HABITATS (E.G., OPHICHTHIDS, LETHRINIDS, EPINEPHELIDS) ARE UNDERREPRESENTED OR HAVE LOW ABUNDANCE.",NA,HOBBS JPA_2014_RAFFLES BULL ZOOL,,,,,,,

WARM-WATER CORAL REEFS, FOR EXAMPLE, OCCUPY SHALLOW SUNLIT, WARM, AND ALKALINE WATERS IN ORDER TO GROW AND CALCIFY AT THE HIGH RATES NECESSARY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN THEIR CALCIUM CARBONATE STRUCTURES. AT DEEPER LOCATIONS (40-150 M), ``MESOPHOTIC'' (LOW LIGHT) CORAL REEFS ACCUMULATE CALCIUM CARBONATE AT MUCH LOWER RATES (IF AT ALL IN SOME CASES) YET REMAIN IMPORTANT AS HABITAT FOR A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISMS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPORTANT FOR FISHERIES. FINALLY, EVEN DEEPER, DOWN TO 2,000 M OR MORE, THE SO-CALLED ``COLD-WATER'' CORAL REEFS ARE FOUND IN THE DARK DEPTHS. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE, CORAL REEFS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES INCLUDING POLLUTION, OVER-HARVESTING, PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. IN THE LATTER CASE, EVEN LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION SCENARIOS (SUCH AS REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY RCP 4.5) ARE LIKELY DRIVE THE ELIMINATION OF MOST WARM-WATER CORAL REEFS BY 2040-2050. COLD-WATER CORALS ARE ALSO THREATENED BY WARMING TEMPERATURES AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE OF THE DIRECT EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS LESS CLEAR. EVIDENCE THAT CORAL REEFS CAN ADAPT AT RATES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO KEEP UP WITH RAPID OCEAN WARMING AND ACIDIFICATION IS MINIMAL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT CORALS ARE LONG-LIVED AND HENCE HAVE SLOW RATES OF EVOLUTION. CONCLUSIONS THAT CORAL REEFS WILL MIGRATE TO HIGHER LATITUDES AS THEY WARM ARE EQUALLY UNFOUNDED, WITH THE OBSERVATIONS OF TROPICAL SPECIES APPEARING AT HIGH LATITUDES ``NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT'' EVIDENCE THAT ENTIRE CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS ARE SHIFTING. ON THE CONTRARY, CORAL REEFS ARE LIKELY TO DEGRADE RAPIDLY OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS, PRESENTING FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES FOR THE 500 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DERIVE FOOD, INCOME, COASTAL PROTECTION, AND A RANGE OF OTHER SERVICES FROM CORAL REEFS.

A LARGE SIZE MAY FACILITATE MUSHROOM CORALS TO ACQUIRE FOOD AND LIGHT, BUT IT MAY ALSO HINDER THEIR CAPACITY TO MOVE AND REJECT SEDIMENTS. A CLADISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE FUNGIIDAE SUGGESTS THAT PHYLOGENETIC INCREASE IN BODY SIZE MAY HAVE INDUCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY MOUTHS IN SEVERAL INDEPENDENT SPECIES LINEAGES. THIS MAY HAVE HELPED THE CORALS TO OVERCOME SIZE CONSTRAINTS AND GROW EVEN LARGER, ESPECIALLY ON REEF FLATS AND SLOPES WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE SEDIMENTATION, BUT NOT NECESSARILY ON THE SOFT SUBSTRATA OF REEF BASES WHERE SPECIES WITH ANCESTRAL SMALL FORMS ARE MOST ABUNDANT. FRAGMENTATION BY AUTOTOMY, WHICH OCCURS MOST FREQUENTLY IN THE LATTER SPECIES, HELPS CORALS TO REMAIN SMALL. ATTACHED MUSHROOM CORAL SPECIES WITH ONE MOUTH ARE THE SMALLEST, WHEREAS THOSE WITH MORE MOUTHS ARE AMONG THE LARGEST. POLYSTOMATOUS FREE-LIVING SPECIES ARE RELATIVELY RARE IN DEEP REEF ZONES. ON SHALLOW, HARD SUBSTRATA, THE EVOLUTION OF SECONDARY MOUTHS MAY PRIMARILY INCREASE THE FEEDING EFFICIENCY. ON SOFT, RELATIVELY DEEP SUBSTRATA, ADDITIONAL MOUTHS MAY HELP TO PREVENT SMOTHERING. IN AT LEAST ONE POLYSTOMATOUS SPECIES, THE ONSET OF SECONDARY MOUTHS STARTS IN AN EARLIER ONTOGENETIC STAGE THAN IN ITS OLIGOSTOMATOUS SISTER SPECIES WITH INFREQUENT ADDITIONAL MOUTHS, WHICH IS AN EXAMPLE OF PREDISPLACEMENT IN PERAMORPHIC HETEROCHRONY. 1990, BRILL.

ADDITIONALLY, FOLLOWING A LOCALIZED MORTALITY EVENT LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CONTINENTAL FLOODING IN SUMMER 2016, WATER SAMPLES FROM UP TO SIMILAR TO 250 M DEPTH WERE COLLECTED IN THE BROADER FGBNMS AREA ON A RAPID RESPONSE CRUISE TO EXAMINE THE SEAWATER CARBONATE SYSTEM.

TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY BOTH PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONTROLLING THE SURFACE WATER CARBONATE SYSTEM DYNAMICS, ALTHOUGH TEMPERATURE WAS THE SOLE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR WHEN THERE WAS NO FLOODING. THE FGBNMS AREA ACTED AS A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CO2 IN WINTER AND A CO2 SOURCE IN SUMMER, WHILE THE TIME-INTEGRATED CO2 FLUX IS CLOSE TO ZERO (- 0.14 +/ - 1.96 MMOL-C M(-2) YR(-1)).

THIS STUDY USED DAILY OPTIMALLY INTERPOLATED SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (DOISST) DATA TO IDENTIFY MAJOR MARINE HEATWAVES (MHWS) THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS REGION OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES (1992-2022). WE THEN USED HIMAWARI-8 (H-8) SST DATA TO MAP SIGNIFICANT MHW EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2022. WE INVESTIGATED THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE MHWS, ASSESSED THIER IMPACT ON SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS AND IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL CORAL REFUGIA. MHWS IN THIS REGION HAVE INCREASED IN FREQUENCY, INTENSITY AND SPATIAL EXTENT. EL NIN SIMILAR TO O, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS IN PHASE WITH POSITIVE INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE, WAS THE KEY REMOTE DRIVER LEADING TO INTENSE MHWS. HOWEVER, THE MORE RECENT STRONG MHWS (E.G., 2017 AND 2022) OCCURRED IN THE ABSCENCE OF THESE CLIMATIC EVENTS, SIGNIFYING THE IMPACTS OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOCAL DRIVERS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT REDUCED WIND SPEED AND SHOALING MIXED LAYER DEPTH, OFTEN TOGETHER WITH REDUCED CLOUDINESS, WERE THE MAIN LOCAL DRIVERS PRE-CONDITIONING THESE MHWS. ANOMALOUS AIR-SEA HEAT FLUX INTO THE OCEAN, MAINLY CONTROLLED BY SHORTWAVE SOLAR RADIATION (CLOUDINESS) AND LATENT HEAT FLUX (WIND), WAS THE MOST CONSTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE 2015-16 AND 2019-20 MHW EVENTS. HOWEVER, LOCAL OCEANOGRAPHIC DYNAMICS, ESPECIALLY HORIZONTAL ADVECTION AND TURBULENT MIXING, PLAYED IMPORTANT ROLES IN MHW HEAT BUDGETS. THIS STUDY CONFIRMED THAT SHALLOW-WATER CORAL BLEACHING SEVERITY WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE CUMULATIVE MHW INTENSITY IN THE 2015-16 AND 2019-20 MHW EVENTS. WE IDENTIFIED SHALLOW REEFS ALONG THE PATH OF THE NORTH QUEENSLAND CURRENT AS POTENTIAL CORAL REFUGIA FROM BLEACHING BECAUSE OF THE COOLER WATERS UPWELLED FROM THE OCEAN CURRENT. WE ALSO FOUND THAT, EXCEPT DURING WEATHER EVENTS SUCH AS TROPICAL CYCLONES, MESOPHOTIC REEFS IN THE CORAL SEA MARINE PARK MAY BE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SEVERE BLEACHING AS THE MHWS WERE MORE CONFINED WITHIN THE SHALLOW MIXED LAYER.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168063,HUANG Z_2024_SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,,,,,,,

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE MAIN STRATIGRAPHICAL, LITHOLOGICAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL PATTERNS, AS WELL AS BASIC DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CORALGAL ASSEMBLAGES, BUT NO DETAILED CORAL COMMUNITY ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN. WE PRESENT A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE NATURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PLEISTOCENE CORAL COMMUNITIES AND APPLY SEVERAL STATISTICAL TOOLS TO DEFINE RECURRENT CORAL ASSOCIATIONS AND COMPARE THE EIGHT REEF-BUILDING CYCLES RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE GBR. THE START OF SIGNIFICANT REEF BUILDING OCCURS AT 137 M BASED ON A MAJOR CHANGE IN CORAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND THE INCEPTION OF THE REEF CYCLES (CY1-8). THIS REVISION, ALONG WITH AVAILABLE STRATIGRAPHICAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL DATA, SUGGESTS THAT BARRIER REEF INITIATION MAY HAVE OCCURRED PRIOR TO MIS 11, EARLIER THAN PREVIOUS REPORTS. THE CORAL ASSEMBLAGES AT 137 M REFLECT THE TRANSITION FROM LOWER MESOPHOTIC (60-100 M) TO UPPER MESOPHOTIC (30-60 M) SETTINGS, WHILE THE EIGHT REEF CYCLES ABOVE ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THREE RECURRENT SHALLOW-WATER REEF-CORAL ASSOCIATIONS: PORITES-MONTIPORA-FAVIIDS (PO-MO-FA), POCILLOPORIDS (POC), AND ACROPORA-ISOPORA (ACRO-ISO). TYPICALLY, THESE CYCLES BEGIN WITH THE PO-MOFA ASSOCIATION AND END WITH THE ACRO-ISO ASSOCIATION, REFLECTING SHALLOWING AND A CATCH-UP GROWTH MODE. HOWEVER, THE FIRST TWO CYCLES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A TRANSITIONAL PHASE DOMINATED BY THE POC ASSOCIATION. THE DOMINANCE OF POCILLOPORIDS DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF THE GBR'S HISTORY AND THE LONG-TERM SHIFT TO AN ACROPORA-ISOPORA-DOMINATED COMMUNITY MAY REFLECT AN INCREASE IN COMPETITIVE PRESSURE OF ACROPORIDS OVER POCILLOPORIDS. OUR FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEW THAT REEF CORAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IS PREDICTABLE OVER 100-KYR TIME SCALE. HOWEVER, VARIATIONS WITHIN REEF CYCLES HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES OPERATING AT MILLENNIAL TIME SCALES.

PREVIOUS WORK DEFINED FIVE REEF SEQUENCES (REEF 1-5) THAT SPAN THE LAST 30,000 YEARS. HERE WE EXAMINED THE VARIATION IN CORALGAL ASSEMBLAGES AND THEIR PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS IN LATE GLACIAL TO DEGLACIAL SEQUENCES FROM 23 HOLES CORED SEAWARD OF THE MODERN GBR IN WATER DEPTHS FROM 46 TO 131 M ALONG FOUR TRANSECTS AT THREE LOCALITIES: HYDROGRAPHERS PASSAGE (HYD-01C AND HYD-02A), NOGGIN PASS (NOG-01B), AND RIBBON REEF (RIB-02A). WE IDENTIFIED THREE CORALLINE ALGAL ASSEMBLAGES AND EIGHT CORAL ASSEMBLAGES INDICATING A BROAD RANGE OF REEF SETTINGS FROM THE SHALLOW REEF CREST (0-5 M) TO THE DEEP FOREREEF SLOPE (> 20 M). WE DOCUMENT IN DETAIL FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DISTRIBUTION AND COMPOSITION OF REEF COMMUNITIES THAT GREW IN THE GBR DURING THE LGM FROM 22,000-19,000 YEARS AGO. THEY INCLUDED CORAL TAXA THAT ARE MAJOR REEF BUILDERS TODAY: ISOPORA, ACROPORA GR. HUMILIS, DIPSASTRAEA GR. PALLIDA, PORITES, AND MONTIPORA. PRIOR TO THE FALL IN SEA LEVEL TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT OF THE LGM, LATE GLACIAL REEF COMMUNITIES DEVELOPED MORE PROXIMALLY (LANDWARD) TO THE MODERN GBR ALONG THE SHELF EDGE. THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND COMPOSITION REFLECT INFLUENCES OF THE OLDER PLEISTOCENE BASEMENT DEPTH AND POSSIBLE TERRIGENOUS SEDIMENT INPUTS. POST-LGM DEGLACIAL REEF GROWTH WAS VIGOROUS IN PROXIMAL SITES AND CHARACTERIZED BY THE ACCRETION OF A VERY SHALLOW HIGH-ENERGY CORALGAL ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSED OF MEDIUM TO ROBUSTLY BRANCHING ACROPORA, INCLUDING A. GR. HUMILIS, AND THICK ALGAL CRUSTS OF POROLITHON GR. ONKODES ASSOCIATED WITH VERMETID GASTROPODS. MORE DISTALLY, REEF GROWTH WAS VARIABLY IMPACTED BY TERRIGENOUS INPUT FOLLOWING DEGLACIAL REFLOODING OF ANTECEDENT REEF TERRACES. THE CORALGAL SUCCESSION AND SEDIMENTARY FACIES IN NOGGIN PASS INDICATE THAT AN EARLY DROWNING TREND WAS LINKED TO INCREASED TURBIDITY THAT WAS LIKELY CONTROLLED BY SHELF MORPHOLOGY (NARROW SHELF, STEEP SLOPE) AND/OR PROXIMITY TO A PALEO-RIVER MOUTH. THE DEGLACIAL SUCCESSION IN RIBBON REEF LACKS TYPICAL SHALLOW-WATER INDICATORS, WHICH MAY REFLECT INFLUENCES OF THE PARTICULARLY STEEP SLOPE OF THE NORTHERN GBR SHELF EDGE ON REEF ZONATION. A MAJOR SEA-LEVEL JUMP AT THE ONSET OF THE YOUNGER DRYAS DISPLACED REEF HABITATS FURTHER UPSLOPE, FORMING A BARRIER REEF SYSTEM MAINLY COMPOSED OF ROBUSTLY BRANCHING ACROPORIDS DISTINCT FROM THE MORE DISTAL SITES.

Nine species combine to form three depth-related assemblages that are characteristic of the major reef-related environments (lagoonpatch reef, reef terraces, and deep reef). These modern plant assemblages form the basis of the use of Halimeda as a sediment tracer. Halimeda-based tracer studies of Holocene sediments indicate that only sediments containing deep reef species of Halimeda are presently being transported through the reef system by sediment creep and being deposited at the juncture of the upper and lower island slope. Sediments containing shallow reef Halimeda are retained within the reef and lithified by marine carbonate cements. Tracer studies of Pleistocene sediment indicate large amounts of reef-derived carbonate sand containing deep water Halimeda were produced during interglacial high stands of sea level. Much of this material was removed by turbidity currents moving out of the reef system to the island slope down submarine channels perpendicular to the reef trend. These channels may still be identified on bathymetric profiles, but are no longer receiving coarse reef debris and are veneered with a blanket of pelagic carbonate mud.",10.1007/BF00302015,JOHNS HD_1988_CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,

THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WHEN TESTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF BAROTRAUMA, WHERE THE INCISION FOR AN INTERNAL TAG WOULD INADVERTENTLY ``VENT'' THE FISH, PRECLUDING AN ``UNVENTED'' OR CONTROL TREATMENT. THE RISE OF BAROTRAUMA EXPERIMENTATION HAS INCREASED THE NEED FOR METHODS FACILITATING THIS DESIGN.

WE USED ACCELEROMETER/DEPTH TAGS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW LONG AN EXTERNALLY TAGGED FISH WOULD RETAIN ITS TAG IN SITU. CHANGES IN ACCELERATION OR CHANGES IN DEPTH WERE USED AS A PROXY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FISH WAS ALIVE OR DEAD OR HAD SHED ITS TAG.

Although cleaning was observed to depths of 30 m, the greatest density of cleaning fishes occurred at a sharp break in the bottom contour at 15 m. Clepticus parrae was the dominant fish cleaned by fishes (80% of events), and the graysby, Petrometopon cruentatum, was most frequently cleaned by Periclimenes. Cleaning was initiated by Gobiosoma at 0600 to 0630 h and continued throughout the day as intense bouts of cleaning activity were interspersed with periods of relative calm. Bodianus patrolled areas of several meters and would sometimes rise over a meter above the substrate to initiate cleaning. In contrast, gobies were much more restricted in both lateral and vertical movements. Gobiosoma and Bodianus cleaned 3104 and 1346 hosts during the study compared to only 207 for Thalassoma.

DESPITE THEIR WIDE DEPTH DISTRIBUTION, COMPARATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE BIOTA ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MACROALGAL SPECIES. OUR PRIMARY GOALS WERE TO PROVIDE BASELINE INFORMATION ON THE FISH FAUNA ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEEP-WATER MACROALGAL MEADOWS AND TO COMPARE THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF FISHES BETWEEN THE MEADOW INTERIOR AND SANDY PERIMETERS. BECAUSE BOTH SPECIES FORM STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX THREE-DIMENSIONAL CANOPIES, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THEY WOULD SUPPORT A GREATER ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF FISHES WHEN COMPARED TO SURROUNDING SANDY AREAS. WE SURVEYED THE FISH FAUNA ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MEADOWS USING VISUAL SURVEYS AND COLLECTIONS MADE WITH CLOVE-OIL ANESTHETIC. USING THESE TECHNIQUES, WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF 49 SPECIES FROM 25 FAMILIES FOR H. KANALOANA MEADOWS AND SURROUNDING SANDY AREAS, AND 28 SPECIES FROM 19 FAMILIES FOR AVRAINVILLEA SP. HABITATS. PERCENT ENDEMISM WAS 28.6\% AND 10.7\%, RESPECTIVELY. WRASSES (FAMILY LABRIDAE) WERE THE MOST SPECIOSE TAXON IN BOTH HABITATS (11 AND SIX SPECIES, RESPECTIVELY), FOLLOWED BY GOBIES FOR H.

TO DETERMINE IF ANTHROPOGENIC LAND-BASED NITROGEN (N) SOURCES SUPPORT THESE HABS, WE COLLECTED MACROALGAL TISSUE FOR STABLE NITROGEN ISOTOPE (815 N) ANALYSIS AT THREE SPATIALLY DISTINCT DEPTHS RANGING FROM THE SHALLOW SUBTIDAL TO THE SHELF BREAK (SIMILAR TO 43 M) ALONG SEVEN TRANSECTS FROM JUPITER TO DEERFIELD BEACH, FLORIDA, USA. THIS SAMPLING WAS INITIATED DURING A HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT DROUGHT IN THE SPRING OF 2001 WHEN RAINFALL, STORMWATER RUNOFF, AND UPWELLING WERE AT A MINIMUM. THE SAMPLING WAS REPEATED IN THE SUMMER WET SEASON FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT STORMWATER RUNOFF AND DURING A STRONG UPWELLING EVENT. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL CHANGES IN N SOURCE AVAILABILITY, DELTA(15) N VALUES DID NOT VARY BETWEEN SAMPLINGS. COLLECTIVELY, DELTA(15) N VALUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON INSHORE SHALLOW REEFS (+8.1 PARTS PER THOUSAND) COMPARED TO MID (+6.1 PARTS PER THOUSAND) AND DEEP REEFS (+6.7 PARTS PER THOUSAND). VALUES WERE ALSO ELEVATED IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE STUDY AREA (E.G., BOCA RATON, +8.5 PARTS PER THOUSAND) WHERE NEARLY 1.5 BILLION 1/DAY OF SECONDARILY TREATED WASTEWATER IS DISCHARGED INTO THE OCEAN VIA COASTAL OUTFALLS. CODIUM ISTHMOCLADUM, A MACROALGA THAT ASSIMILATES ITS NUTRIENTS ENTIRELY FROM THE WATER COLUMN, WAS THE DOMINANT BLOOM SPECIES IN THE SOUTHERN STUDY AREA, WHERE TISSUE DELTA(15) N VALUES MATCHED SOURCE VALUES OF NEARBY SEWAGE OUTFALLS. THE NORTHERN STUDY AREA WAS DOMINATED BY SPECIES OF THE GENUS CAULERPA, PARTICULARLY THE INVASIVE PACIFIC NATIVE C BRACHYPUS VAR.

THE NORTHERN AREA DOES NOT HAVE SEWAGE OUTFALLS BUT FEATURES A HIGHLY TRANSMISSIVE GEOLOGIC ZONE WHERE SGD MAY BE ENRICHED WITH SEPTIC TANK LEACHATE AND EFFLUENT FROM MUNICIPAL DEEP INJECTION WELLS. MULTIPLE LINES OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LAND-BASED SEWAGE N WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN UPWELLING AS A N SOURCE TO THESE HABS: (1)DELTA(15) N VALUES WERE HIGHEST ON SHALLOW REEFS AND DECREASED WITH INCREASING DEPTH, INDICATING LAND-BASED SOURCES OF ENRICHMENT; (2) ELEVATED DELTA(15) N VALUES OCCURRED IN THESE HABS DURING THE DRY SEASON, PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE SUMMER UPWELLING; (3) ELEVATED NH4+ CONCENTRATIONS OCCUR ON THESE REEFS DURING BOTH UPWELLING AND NON-UPWELLING PERIODS AND ARE KINETICALLY PREFERRED BY MACROALGAE COMPARED TO UPWELLED NO3-.

DUE TO THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND AVAILABILITY OF PREY, A LARGE POPULATION OF BULL SHARKS (CARCHARHINUS LEUCAS) EXISTS IN THIS MPA. HISTORICAL RECORDS ABOUT THE ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THESE SHARKS IN THE PARK ARE SCARCE. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF 32 BULL SHARKS WITHIN CPNP USING A PASSIVE ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY ARRAY (N = 13) LOCATED ALONG THE PARK TO EXAMINE HOW THE RESIDENCY OF THE SPECIES CHANGE SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY. ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE TAKEN IN SITU (HOBOS) AND COMPLEMENTED WITH SATELLITE INFORMATION (MODIS AQUA). THE MEAN RESIDENCE INDEX (RI) WAS 0.365 (SD 0.2143).

THE PROSPECT THAT DEEPER ENVIRONMENTS COULD SERVE AS REFUGIA IS PROMISING BUT REMAINS UNCERTAIN, AS IT HAS BEEN EVALUATED PRIMARILY IN BENTHIC TAXA AND ON SMALL SPATIAL SCALES. WE USE A DATASET OF ALL BIOTA FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TO EVALUATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH SPECIES' OCCURRENCES EXTEND ACROSS SHALLOW (0-30 M), MESOPHOTIC (>30-150 M), AND DEEP (>150 M) ENVIRONMENTS. HIGH PERCENTAGES OF SPECIES INHABIT MULTIPLE DEPTH ZONES: 70\% OF BENTHIC AND 81\% OF PELAGIC SPECIES OCCURRING IN THE MESOPHOTIC ZONE ARE ALSO FOUND IN THE SHALLOW ZONE, AND 45\% OF BENTHIC AND 80\% OF PELAGIC SPECIES FOUND IN THE SHALLOW ZONE EXTEND INTO MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR CONFOUNDING EFFECTS USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION, PELAGIC SPECIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ODDS OF EXTENDING BETWEEN DEPTH ZONES THAN BENTHIC SPECIES. ANALYSES OF SPECIES IN ADJACENT 20 M DEPTH BANDS REVEAL TAXONOMICALLY DISTINCT COMMUNITIES OF BENTHIC SPECIES FROM 0 TO 100 M AND PELAGIC SPECIES FROM 0 TO 200 M. PEAKS IN PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS SHOW THAT PELAGIC SPECIES GENERALLY HAVE BROADER DEPTH RANGES THAN BENTHIC SPECIES.

A COMPILATION OF BATHYMETRIC DATA WAS USED TO EXPLORE A REGIONAL LEVEL MODEL, AND NOVEL HIGH-RESOLUTION MULTIBEAM DATA WERE USED TO DETAIL SPECIFIC PORTIONS OF THE REGION, WITH EMPHASIS ON SHELF-SLOPE TRANSITIONS AND SHELF-EDGE REEFS. THE ANALYSES REVEALED A COMPLEX MOSAIC OF BENTHIC MEGAHABITATS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED TO THE SHELF'S MORPHOLOGY, DISTANCE OFFSHORE, AND SEDIMENT DISCHARGE AND TRANSPORT. THE MASSIVE AND CONTINUOUS TERRIGENOUS SEDIMENT INPUT IS ASSOCIATED TO A SMOOTH MUDDY DEPOSIT ALONG THE INNER AND MID SHELF (REGULAR CONTINENTAL SHELF MEGAHABITAT). THE PORTIONS OF THE SHELF THAT ARE LESS INFLUENCED BY RIVERINE SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION ARE ROUGHER AND CHARACTERIZED BY EITHER SAND (IRREGULAR SAND CONTINENTAL SHELF MEGAHABITAT) OR CARBONATE-DOMINATED BOTTOM (IRREGULAR REEF CONTINENTAL SHELF MEGAHABITAT). THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS AND MEGAHABITATS CAN BE OBSERVED ALONG THE OUTER SHELF AND SHELF BREAK. THE SHELF-SLOPE TRANSITION MEGAHABITAT IS MARKED BY RIDGES IN THE SHELF BREAK AND BY A MORE ACUTE DEPTH GRADIENT THAT FORMS A DISTINCT OUTER SHELF EDGE. THREE DIFFERENT ALONGSHORE SECTORS WERE EXPLORED IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THE HETEROGENEOUS MEGAHABITAT MOSAIC IN TERMS OF SLOPE AND BOTTOM MORPHOLOGY. THE WESTERN-MOST SECTOR (S3) IS REMARKABLE DUE TO AN INDISTINCT SEPARATION BETWEEN RIDGES AND THE OUTER SHELF EDGE, AS WELL AS FOR PRESENTING REEFS WITH UP TO 20 M HIGH, BETWEEN 110- AND 210-M WATER DEPTHS.

MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS (MCES), OCCURRING FROM 30 TO 40 M AND DEEPER IN TROPICAL LOCATIONS, HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO A SURGE OF RESEARCH THIS CENTURY. THOUGH A NUMBER OF VALUABLE NARRATIVE REVIEWS EXIST, A SYSTEMATIC QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS OF PUBLISHED MCE STUDIES IS LACKING. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW TO COLLATE MESOPHOTIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING STUDIES FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT. WE HIGHLIGHT CURRENT BIASES IN RESEARCH EFFORT, REGARDING LOCATIONS AND SUBJECT MATTER, AND SUGGEST WHERE MORE ATTENTION MAY BE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE. FOLLOWING A NOTABLE NUMBER OF STUDIES CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL FOR MESOPHOTIC REEFS TO ACT AS REFUGES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW COMPREHENSIVE THESE SOURCES OF RECRUITS AND ORGANISMS CAPABLE OF MOVING TO SHALLOW WATER REEFS MAY BE. METHODS: WE SEARCH SEVEN SOURCES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA WITH TWO SEARCH STRINGS, AS WELL AS PERSONAL LIBRARIES. ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY CONTAINED SPECIES PRESENCE DATA FROM BOTH SHALLOWER AND DEEPER THAN 30 M DEPTH ON TROPICAL CORAL REEFS. STUDIES WERE CRITICALLY APPRAISED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SPECIES IDENTIFIED AND BALANCED SAMPLING EFFORT WITH DEPTH. MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM DEPTHS PER SPECIES WERE EXTRACTED FROM EACH STUDY, ALONG WITH STUDY REGION AND TAXON. WE QUANTIFIED THE DEGREE OF COMMUNITY OVERLAP BETWEEN SHALLOW TROPICAL REEFS (<30 M) AND REEFS SURVEYED AT THE SAME LOCATIONS BELOW 30 M. PROPORTIONS OF SHALLOW SPECIES, ACROSS ALL STUDIED TAXA, OBSERVED DEEPER THAN 30 M WERE USED TO GENERATE LOG ODDS RATIOS AND PASSED TO A MIXED-EFFECTS MODEL. STUDY LOCATION AND TAXON WERE INCLUDED AS EFFECT MODIFIERS. FUNNEL PLOTS, REGRESSION TESTS, FAIL SAFE NUMBERS, AND ANALYSIS OF A HIGH VALIDITY SUBGROUP CONTRIBUTED TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSES AND TESTS OF BIAS. RESULTS: ACROSS ALL STUDIES SYNTHESISED WE FOUND TWO-THIRDS OF SHALLOW SPECIES WERE PRESENT ON MESOPHOTIC REEFS. FURTHER ANALYSIS BY TAXON AND BROAD LOCATIONS SHOW THAT THIS PATTERN IS INFLUENCED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND TAXONOMICALLY. COMMUNITY OVERLAP WAS ESTIMATED AS LOW AS 26\% AND AS HIGH AS 97\% FOR SOME CASES. CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS CLEAR SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PROTECTING MESOPHOTIC REEFS WILL ALSO HELP TO CONSERVE SHALLOW WATER SPECIES. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS STUDY DOES NOT ADDRESS MESOPHOTIC-SPECIALIST COMMUNITIES, OR THE ECOLOGICAL FORCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT REFUGE DYNAMICS. AS WE LIMIT OUR ANALYSIS TO SPECIES ONLY PRESENT ABOVE 30 M IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE DIVERSITY FOUND EXCLUSIVELY DEEPER THAN 30 M WARRANTS PROTECTION IN ITS OWN RIGHT. FURTHER RESEARCH INTO RELATIVELY IGNORED TAXA AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WILL HELP IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF PROTECTED AREAS IN FUTURE.",10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1,LAVERICK JH_2018_ENVIRON EVID,,,,,,,

A LESS IMPACTED POPULATION AT DEPTH COULD PROVIDE RECRUITS TO RECOLONISE SHALLOW REEFS. RECENTLY, DISTURBANCE HAS BEEN REPORTED ON SEVERAL MESOPHOTIC REEFS INCLUDING STORM DAMAGE, BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS, AND CORAL BLEACHING; CALLING INTO QUESTION THE EXTENT OF DEEP REEF REFUGES. WE REPORT ON A RECIPROCAL TRANSPLANT EXPERIMENT BETWEEN SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC REEFS IN THE CARIBBEAN, WHICH OCCURRED DURING A PERIOD OF CORAL BLEACHING. 102 FRAGMENTS OF AGARICIA LAMARCKI WERE COLLECTED DOWN A CONTINUOUS DEPTH GRADIENT AT TWO SITES TO A MAXIMUM DEPTH OF 60M. FRAGMENTS WERE TRANSPLANTED TO EITHER A SHALLOW OR MESOPHOTIC STATION AT A THIRD SITE, WITH CONTROLS. THIS ALLOWED THE DISAGGREGATION OF THE EFFECT OF THE DISTURBANCE EXPERIENCED DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, AND ANY POTENTIAL ACCLIMATION RESULTING FROM THE HISTORICAL LOCATION OF A FRAGMENT. MORTALITY AND BLEACHING WERE QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSED. WE FOUND THE RELOCATION DEPTH OF A CORAL FRAGMENT HAD THE STRONGEST EFFECT ON BOTH SURVIVAL AND THE DEGREE OF BLEACHING RECORDED. THE SITE A FRAGMENT WAS COLLECTED FROM, AND THE ORIGINAL COLLECTION DEPTH, FAILED TO EXPLAIN MORTALITY OR BLEACHING WITH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS EXPERIMENT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE ASSUMPTION THAT MESOPHOTIC CORALS MAY BE PROTECTED IN COMPARISON TO SHALLOW REEFS, IN SPITE OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF DIFFERING SUSCEPTIBILITIES TO STRESS.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.12.013,LAVERICK JH_2018_MAR ENVIRON RES,,,,,,,

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS DOCUMENTED TRENDS IN HETEROTROPHY AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS WITH DEPTH, BUT HAS NOT ADDRESSED BETWEEN-SITE VARIATION FOR A SINGLE SPECIES. ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SITES AT A LOCAL SCALE AND HETEROGENEOUS MICROHABITATS, BECAUSE OF IRRADIANCE AND FOOD AVAILABILITY, ARE LIKELY IMPORTANT FACTORS WHEN EXPLAINING THE OCCURRENCE AND PHYSIOLOGY OF SCLERACTINIA. HERE, 108 COLONIES OF AGARICIA LAMARCKI WERE SAMPLED FROM TWO LOCATIONS OFF THE COAST OF UTILA, HONDURAS, DISTRIBUTED EVENLY DOWN THE OBSERVED 50 M DEPTH RANGE OF THE SPECIES. WE FOUND THAT DEPTH ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO FULLY EXPLAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIATION. PULSE AMPLITUDE-MODULATION FLUOROMETRY AND STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSES REVEALED THAT TRENDS IN PHOTOCHEMICAL AND HETEROTROPHIC ACTIVITY WITH DEPTH VARIED MARKEDLY BETWEEN SITES. OUR ISOTOPE ANALYSES DO NOT SUPPORT AN OBLIGATE LINK BETWEEN PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY AND HETEROTROPHIC SUBSIDY WITH INCREASING DEPTH. WE FOUND THAT A. LAMARCKI COLONIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SPECIES DEPTH RANGE CAN BE PHYSIOLOGICALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE NEARER THE SURFACE. AS A POTENTIAL EXPLANATION, WE HYPOTHESIZE SITES WITH HIGH TOPOGRAPHICAL COMPLEXITY, AND THEREFORE VARIED MICROHABITATS, MAY PROVIDE MORE PHYSIOLOGICAL NICHES DISTRIBUTED ACROSS A LARGER DEPTH RANGE. VARIED MICROHABITATS WITH DEPTH MAY REDUCE THE DOMINANCE OF DEPTH AS A PHYSIOLOGICAL DETERMINANT. THUS, A. LAMARCKI MAY `AVOID' CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENT WITH DEPTH, BY INSTEAD EXISTING IN A SUBSET OF FAVOURABLE NICHES.

WE PROJECTED THESE AS DEPTH BANDS USING LIGHT ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD, AND PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS. RESULTS WE FOUND LIGHT RELATIONSHIPS ALONE ARE SUFFICIENT TO CAPTURE MAJOR ECOLOGICAL FEATURES ACROSS CORAL REEF DEPTH GRADIENTS. OUR MODEL SUPPORTS THE DEPTH LIMITS CURRENTLY USED IN CORAL REEF ECOLOGY, PREDICTING A GLOBAL RANGE FOR THE SHALLOW-UPPER MESOPHOTIC BOUNDARY AT 36.1 M +/- 5.6 AND THE UPPER-LOWER MESOPHOTIC BOUNDARY AT 61.9 M +/- 9.6. HOWEVER, OUR MODEL ALLOWS RESEARCHERS TO MOVE PAST THESE FIXED DEPTH LIMITS, AND QUANTITATIVELY PREDICT THE DEPTHS OF REEF ZONES IN LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. MAIN CONCLUSIONS THE USE OF DEPTH AS A PROXY FOR CHANGES IN CORAL REEF COMMUNITIES OFFERS NO GUIDANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION BETWEEN SITES. WE HAVE SHOWN IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE LIGHT TO PREDICT THE DEPTH BOUNDARIES OF REEF ZONES AS A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE, AND TO ACCOMMODATE THIS VARIABILITY. PREDICTING THE DEPTHS OF REEF ZONES IN UNUSUAL LIGHT ENVIRONMENTS SUGGESTS THAT SHALLOW-WATER TURBID REEFS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS.

IN THE SALISH SEA, A REGION OF THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC CHARACTERIZED BY STEEP, GLACIER-CARVED ROCKY REEFS, RED SEA URCHINS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO 125 M DEPTH. CONSIDERING THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THIS SPECIES, WE PREDICTED RED SEA URCHINS COULD BE FOUND DEEPER THAN 125 M IN AREAS WITH HARD SUBSTRATE AND ABUNDANT DRIFT.

IN ADDITION, WE QUANTIFIED THE RATE OF DRIFT CAPTURE BY SEA URCHINS AT THE UPPER BOUNDARY OF THE MESOPHOTIC ZONE TO ASSESS PATTERNS OF FOOD AVAILABILITY. A RED SEA URCHIN WAS OBSERVED AT 284 M, MORE THAN DOUBLING THIS SPECIES' KNOWN DEPTH RANGE. RED SEA URCHINS AND DRIFT WERE OBSERVED IN ALL DEPTH ZONES SURVEYED AND 24\% OF SEA URCHINS HAD CAPTURED DRIFT.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE MODELED EARLY DIAGENESIS IN A STATIC DEPOSITIONAL FRAMEWORK. THEY FOLLOWED A RULE-BASED MODELING APPROACH INSTEAD OF APPLYING RIGOROUS THERMODYNAMICS AND REACTION KINETICS. THIS STUDY HAS DEVELOPED A PSEUDO-COUPLED APPROACH BASED ON A DYNAMIC DEPOSITIONAL FRAMEWORK AND REACTIVE TRANSPORT MODELING FOR DIAGENESIS. IT HAS BEEN TESTED FOR THE ``POMPANO'' REEF NORTH OF MIAMI, FLORIDA. THE MODEL INCLUDES FIVE REEF PARASEQUENCES DEPOSITED OVER 9.0 KYR WITH FIVE FACIES ZONES. AFTER DEPOSITION OF THE FIRST PARASEQUENCE, DIAGENETIC PROCESSES ARE MODELED. THE RESULTING FRAMEWORK FORMS THE STARTING CONDITION FOR DEPOSITING THE NEXT PARASEQUENCE. SUBSEQUENTLY, ITS DIAGENETIC OVERPRINT AND THE CONTINUED OVERPRINT IN THE UNDERLYING PARASEQUENCE(S) ARE MODELED. THESE WORKFLOW STEPS ARE REPEATED UNTIL ALL FIVE PARASEQUENCES ARE COVERED. T HE RESULTS SHOW THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DEVELOPMENT OF CALCITE CEMENTATION AND POROSITY DISTRIBUTION. DURING THE REEF CATCH-UP PHASE, CEMENT MAINLY DEVELOPED AT THE DEPOSITIONAL SURFACE (UP TO 10\% OF THE TOTAL SEDIMENT VOLUME). DURING THE KEEP-UP PHASE, CEMENT ABUNDANCE INCREASES TO A MAXIMUM VALUE OF SIMILAR TO 17\%. AFTER THE REEF'S DEMISE, CEMENT FORMS A CRUST AT THE SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE WITH UP TO 38\% OF THE TOTAL SEDIMENT VOLUME. IN GENERAL, CONTROLLING FACTORS OF CEMENT DISTRIBUTION INCLUDE FACIES-SPECIFIC FLOW VELOCITIES, REEF FACIES, RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL CHANGES, DEPOSITIONAL GAPS, AND SEAWATER SALINITY. THE MODELING RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ARE WELL ALIGNED WITH THE ACTUAL CEMENT AND POROSITY DISTRIBUTION IN THE POMPANO REEF AND WITH OTHER SUB-RECENT AND ANCIENT EXAMPLES DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE. PSEUDO-COUPLED DEPOSITIONAL-DIAGENETIC MODELING REPRESENTS A SUITABLE APPROACH FOR QUANTITATIVE POROSITY PREDICTION IN COMPARABLE DEPOSITIONAL AND DIAGENETIC SETTINGS.

MEAN K-Q0 COEFFICIENTS WERE ESTIMATED FROM 509 VERTICAL PROFILES OF PAR COLLECTED DURING 10 CRUISES SPANNING 30 MONTHS (1992-1994). VERTICAL PROFILES OF DENSITY REVEALED THAT THE SHELF WATERS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO PERIODS: A STRATIFIED PERIOD WITH AN UPPER LAYER 10 M THICK OF TURBID WATERS (0.06 <= K-Q0 <= 1.18 M(-1)) AND A LOWER LAYER OF MORE TRANSPARENT WATERS (0.01 <= K-Q0 <= 0.49 M(-1)). THE SECOND OR NON-STRATIFIED PERIOD CONSISTS OF A HOMOGENOUS LAYER SIMILAR TO 55 M THICK AND LESS TURBID WATERS (0.03 <= K-Q0 <= 1.00 M(-1)). HORIZONTALLY, THE DISTRIBUTION OF K-Q0 REVEALS NEARSHORE COASTAL OR CASE 2 WATERS FOLLOWED BY OFFSHORE OCEANIC OR CASE 1 WATERS THAT SEPARATE NEAR THE 70-M ISOBATH REGARDLESS OF TIME AND PLACE. THE K-Q0 DISTRIBUTION REFLECTS THE FRESHWATER INFLUX FROM THE MISSISSIPPI AND ATCHAFALAYA RIVERS WHICH CAUSES A TURBID SURFACE TRAPPED RIVER PLUME, THE SHELF WIND-DRIVEN CIRCULATION, AND ENSUING MIXING. TO INVESTIGATE K-Q0 WE USED TWO REGRESSION MODELS INVOLVING SALINITY, SUSPENDED PARTICULATE MATTER (SPM), CHLOROPHYLL-A (CHL), AND WATER DEPTH. THE BEST STATISTICAL MODEL EXPLAINED 57\% TO 85\% OF THE OBSERVED K-Q0 VARIABILITY AND INVOLVED THE RECIPROCAL OF WATER DEPTH, SALINITY, AND SPM. HOWEVER, A MORE BIO-OPTICALLY RELEVANT MODEL INVOLVING SALINITY, SPM, AND CHL, EXPLAINED ONLY 32\% TO 64\% OF THE OBSERVED K-Q0 VARIABILITY. ESTIMATES OF K-Q0 FOR THE UPPER LAYER INDICATE COMPENSATION DEPTHS OF 30-92 M IN WATERS DEEPER THAN 70 M WHICH HELP ACCOUNT FOR THE PRESENCE OF CORAL COMMUNITIES ON SUBMERGED BANKS NEAR THE SHELF EDGE.

OVERALL FISH DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS DECLINED WITH INCREASING DEPTH BUT INCREASED WITH DISTANCE OFFSHORE, SUCH THAT DEEP OFFSHORE ASSEMBLAGES SUPPORTED SIMILAR RICHNESS TO SHALLOW INSHORE SITES. THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FISH ASSEMBLAGE OCCURRED AT DEPTHS < 1 M AND SIMILAR TO 25\% OF SPECIES WERE OBSERVED IN ONLY THE SHALLOWEST 5 M. HOWEVER, SIMILAR TO 60\% OF SPECIES OCCURRED AT OR BELOW 20 M AND 24\% WERE BROADLY DISTRIBUTED FROM < 1 TO 30 M, WITH DEPTH RANGES OF MANY SPECIES INCREASING WITH DISTANCE OFFSHORE. STRONG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FISH ABUNDANCE AND CORAL HABITAT WERE OBSERVED, AND 85\% OF SPECIES THAT WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CORAL OCCURRED AT DEPTHS >= 20 M. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WHILE MANY SPECIES ARE RESTRICTED TO VULNERABLE SHALLOW DEPTHS, DEEP OFFSHORE REEFS PROVIDE A POTENTIAL REFUGE FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF CORAL-ASSOCIATED FISHES THREATENED BY DEGRADATION OF SHALLOW COASTAL REEFS, AND DEEP REEFS SHOULD BE AFFORDED GREATER CONSIDERATION IN CONSERVATION PLANNING FOR CORAL REEF FISHES.",10.3354/meps11953,MACDONALD C_2016_MAR ECOL -PROG SER,,,,,,,

MARGINAL HABITATS MAY REPRESENT IMPORTANT REFUGES IF INDIVIDUALS CAN ACQUIRE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE. HOWEVER, RESOURCES AT RANGE MARGINS ARE OFTEN DISTRIBUTED MORE SPARSELY; THEREFORE, INCREASED EFFORT TO ACQUIRE RESOURCES CAN RESULT IN SUBOPTIMAL PERFORMANCE AND LEAD TO MARGINAL POPULATIONS BECOMING NON-SELF-SUSTAINING SINK-POPULATIONS. SHIFTING RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IS LIKELY TO BE PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR DIETARY SPECIALISTS. HERE, WE USE EXTENSIVE IN SITU BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATIONS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION MEASUREMENTS TO EXAMINE THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF RESOURCEACQUISITION ALONG A DEPTH GRADIENT IN TWO OBLIGATE CORALLIVORE REEF FISHES WITH CONTRASTING LEVELS OF DIETARY SPECIALIZATION. AS EXPECTED, THE SPACE USED TO SECURE CORAL RESOURCES INCREASED TOWARDS THE LOWER DEPTH MARGIN. HOWEVER, INCREASED TERRITORY SIZES RESULTED IN EQUAL OR GREATER AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES WITHIN DEEPER TERRITORIES. IN ADDITION, WE OBSERVED DECREASED COMPETITION AND NO DIFFERENCES IN FORAGING DISTANCE, PAIRING BEHAVIOUR, BODY CONDITION OR FECUNDITY AT GREATER DEPTHS. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATION, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT CORAL-OBLIGATE FISHES CAN SELECT HIGH-QUALITY CORAL PATCHES ON THE DEEPER-REEF TO ACCESS EQUAL OR GREATER RESOURCES THAN THEIR SHALLOW-WATER COUNTERPARTS, WITH NO EXTRA COSTS.

THE INFLUENCE OF BIOTIC (ABUNDANCE OF FISH TROPHIC GROUPS) AND ABIOTIC (BENTHIC COMPLEXITY, DEPTH, AND LIGHT) VARIABLES ON BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WAS EVALUATED WITH SCUBA AND A REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE. WE RECORDED 77 BENTHIC TAXA IN SIX GROUPS (MACROALGAE, PORIFERA, CNIDARIA, ANNELIDA, TUNICATA, AND BRYOZOA). MACROALGAE WAS THE RICHEST GROUP (41 INFRAGENERIC TAXA), WITH 17 NEW RECORDS FOR THE SPSPA. TURF ALGAE WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT GROUP IN BOTH THE EUPHOTIC AND MESOPHOTIC SAMPLES (26 SPECIES), BUT ONLY EIGHT TURF-FORMING SPECIES OCCURRED IN THE LATTER.

PHOTOSYMBIOTIC CORALS CAN THRIVE DOWN TO THE LIMITS OF THE PHOTIC ZONE, AND THE CORAL COMMUNITIES LIVING IN THE LOWER PART OF THE PHOTIC ZONE ARE KNOWN AS MESOPHOTIC CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS (MCE). RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MCES WERE ALREADY PRESENT IN THE MIDDLE PALAEOZOIC. THE REEFS OF THAT TIME REACHED THE PEAK OF THEIR DIS-TRIBUTION DURING THE GIVETIAN, WHEN THEY WERE PRESENT EVEN AS FAR AS 50S. ONE OF THE SOUTHERNMOST GIVETIAN REEFS IS THE AFERDOU EL MRAKIB REEF, EXPOSED IN THE EASTERN ANTI-ATLAS (MOROCCO). AT THE BASE OF THIS REEF, NUMEROUS SMALL CARBONATE BIOHERMS ARE EXPOSED. THESE STRUCTURES FORMED LOW-RELIEF BANKS THAT DEVELOPED PROBABLY AT MODERATE WATER DEPTHS OF SEVERAL TENS OF METERS. IN THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION, WE ANALYSE THE PALEOECOLOGY OF THESE PECULIAR COMMUNITIES. THE ASSEMBLAGE IS DOMINATED BY PLATY AND ENCRUSTING COENITID (ROSEOPORELLA) AND ALVEOLITID (ALVEOLITES) TABULATE CORALS, AS WELL AS ABUNDANT PLATY STROMATOPOROIDS AND SOLITARY CYSTYPHILLID RUGOSE CORALS. THE PLATY MORPHOLOGY OF CORALS IS WIDELY CONSIDERED AS AN ADAPTATION RELATED TO PHOTOSYMBIOSIS, AND IS ESPECIALLY COMMON IN MCES. IN COMBINATION WITH PALAEOBATHYMETRIC AND SEDIMENTOLOGICAL DATA, THIS CHARAC-TERISTIC SUGGESTS THAT THE STUDIED BANKS DEVELOPED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EUPHOTIC ZONE. THE MCES OF THE AFERDOU EL MRAKIB REEF SHARE MAJOR TAXONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL SIMILARITIES WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED MCES FROM THE SOUTHERN SHELF OF LAURUSSIA AND A REEF COMMUNITY FROM SOUTHERN CHINA, EMPHASIZING A HIGH DEGREE OF COSMO-POLITANISM OF THE MIDDLE DEVONIAN MESOPHOTIC ECOSYSTEMS.

THE SOLITARY ISLANDS MARINE PARK (SIMP) IN NEW SOUTH WALES (NSW), AUSTRALIA, HAS STRONG CROSS-SHELF PATTERNS OF REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES ON SHALLOW REEFS (< 25 M). WHILE THE SIMP ALSO CONTAINS REEF AT DEPTHS OF UP TO 75 M, MARINE COMMUNITIES BELOW 25M ARE POORLY DESCRIBED. THE HABITAT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (HCS) USED FOR PLANNING THE ARRANGEMENT OF ZONES IN THIS MARINE PARK INCLUDED THREE DEPTH CATEGORIES FOR REEF: SHALLOW (< 25 M); INTERMEDIATE (25-60 M); AND DEEP (> 60 M). HOWEVER, THESE HAD NOT BEEN TESTED TO DETERMINE IF THEY ADEQUATELY REFLECT BIOTIC PATTERNS. 2. USING BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO (BRUV), FISH ASSEMBLAGES WERE SURVEYED AT 56 SITES SPREAD ACROSS SHALLOW, INTERMEDIATE, AND DEEP REEFS WITHIN THE SIMP TO EXAMINE SPATIAL VARIATION BETWEEN DEPTH CATEGORIES. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ASSEMBLAGE PATTERNS, DEPTH, AND FOUR ADDITIONAL FACTORS CONSIDERED LIKELY TO AFFECT ASSEMBLAGE PATTERNS (DISTANCE FROM SHORE, REEF TYPE, DOMINANT BENTHOS, AND LATITUDE), WERE SUBSEQUENTLY EXPLORED USING MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHODS. 3. REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG THE DEPTH CATEGORIES. ASSEMBLAGE PATTERNS FOR FISH WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH DEPTH AND MODERATELY CORRELATED WITH THE DOMINANT BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGE. CORRELATIONS WITH THE OTHER FACTORS WERE GENERALLY WEAK. THREE DISTINCT ASSEMBLAGES OCCURRED ON REEFS < 25 M, 25-50M AND > 50 M. SHALLOW (< 25 M) REEFS ALSO DISPLAYED STRONG CROSS-SHELF PATTERNS, SUPPORTING THE RESULTS FROM OTHER STUDIES. WEAKER CROSS-SHELF PATTERNS WERE EVIDENT AT INTERMEDIATE DEPTHS (25-50 M). 4. DEPTH-BASED AND CROSS-SHELF CATEGORIES ARE CLEARLY FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS FOR A HCS THAT WILL ADEQUATELY REPRESENT REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING IN THE SIMP. FURTHER REFINING THE DEPTH CRITERIA FOR THE INTERMEDIATE/DEEP BOUNDARY (TO 50 M) IMPROVES THIS REPRESENTATION.

THE CORAL SHOW CHARACTERISTIC TRANSITIONS FROM SPHERICAL MORPHOLOGIES (SHALLOW DEPTHS, 5 M DEEP) TO FLAT AND BRANCHING GEOMETRIES (MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS, 60 M DEEP). SUCH CHANGES ARE TYPICALLY ASCRIBED TO THE ALGAL PHOTOSYMBIONT PHYSIOLOGICAL FEEDBACK WITH THE CORAL THAT HOST THEM. WE FIND SPECIFIC FINE-SCALE SKELETAL VARIABILITY IN ACCRETION OF STRUCTURE AT SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC DEPTH MORPHOTYPES THAT SUGGEST UNDERLYING GENOMIC REGULATION OF BIOMINERALIZATION PATHWAYS OF THE CORAL HOST. TO EXPLAIN THIS, WE CONDUCTED COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGY-BASED ANALYSES, INCLUDING OPTICAL AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, TOMOGRAPHY AND X-RAY DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS COUPLED WITH A COMPREHENSIVE TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS OF S.

THIS ALLOWED US TO DETERMINE WHICH TRAITS STEM FROM HOSTING DIFFERENT SYMBIONT SPECIES COMPOSITIONS ACROSS THE DEPTH GRADIENT. CALCULATION OF HOLOBIONT TROPHIC POSITION BASED ON AMINO ACID DELTA N-15 REVEALED THAT HETEROTROPHY REPRESENTS THE SAME PORTION OF THE TOTAL ENERGY BUDGET IN BOTH DEPTHS, IN CONTRAST TO THE DOGMA THAT PREDATION IS HIGHER IN CORALS GROWING IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS. PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS THE MAJOR CARBON SOURCE TO CORALS GROWING AT BOTH DEPTHS, BUT THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATE IS HIGHER IN THE SHALLOW REEF CORALS, IMPLICATING BOTH HIGHER ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND HIGHER PREDATION RATE IN THE SHALLOW HABITAT.

THE MANY FUSED TEETH THAT FORM THE PARROT-LIKE BEAK OF O. WOODWARDI ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH STRONG MUSCULAR PLATE-LIKE JAWS TO SHEAR/CHOP OFF PIECES OF SPONGE AND CRUSH THE SPICULE-CONTAINING SKELETON. DESPITE THE POTENTIALLY FORMIDABLE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL DEFENCES (SILICEOUS SPICULES AND SECONDARY METABOLITES) OF SPONGES, THESE INVERTEBRATES CONSTITUTE THE MAIN PREY OF O. WOODWARDI. SPONGES WERE THUS INGESTED BY 44\% OF O. WOODWARDI AND CONTRIBUTED 38\% TO THE VOLUME OF THE STOMACH CONTENTS ACROSS A WIDE LENGTH RANGE OF FISH. THE VOLUMETRIC CONTRIBUTION OF SPONGES WAS, HOWEVER, FAR LESS IN THE STOMACHS THAN INTESTINES, WHEREAS THE REVERSE WAS TRUE FOR TELEOSTS. THIS IS PRESUMABLY DUE TO SPONGES UNDERGOING LESS DIGESTION THAN THE EXTERNALLY SOFT-BODIED TELEOSTS AS FOOD PASSES THROUGH THE GUT, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LARGE NUMBERS OF MAINLY INTACT SPICULES PRESENT IN THE INTESTINE. SINCE THE PORIFERAN PREY CONSISTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF SPECIES OF THE TETRACTINELLIDA, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE THREE OTHER SPECIOSE SPONGE ORDERS IN THE REGION WHERE O. WOODWARDI FEEDS IN SOUTHERN WESTERN AUSTRALIA, THIS PREDATOR APPARENTLY SELECTS THE SPONGE TAXA IT INGESTS. THE LENGTH OF THE SILICEOUS SPICULES OF THE TETRACTINELLIDA OFTEN EXCEEDS 2000 MU M, A VALUE NEARLY TEN TIMES THAT WHICH ACTS AS A DETERRENT IN ANOTHER FISH PREDATOR-SPONGE INTERACTION. THUS, DESPITE POSSESSING FORMIDABLE DEFENCE MECHANISMS, TETRACTINELLINIDS ARE PALATABLE TO O. WOODWARDI. THE NEXT MOST IMPORTANT PREY AFTER SPONGES WAS TELEOST FISH (AMONG WHICH CLUPEIDS WERE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT), BEING INGESTED BY 35\% OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMPRISING 28\% OF THE STOMACH CONTENTS. OTHER MAJOR INVERTEBRATE PREY COMPRISED HARD-BODIED CRUSTACEANS (MAINLY DECAPOD CRABS), ECHINODERMS, BIVALVES AND CEPHALOPODS (WITH THEIR HARD BEAKS AND INTERNAL SHELLS), ALL OF WHICH WERE PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTICULAR HABITAT OCCUPIED BY TETRACTINELLID SPONGES. THESE HARD-BODIED PREY ARE PROCESSED BY O. WOODWARDI THROUGH THE CRUSHING ACTION OF ITS STRONG JAW MECHANISM. IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR O.

VULNERABILITY MAY BE ESPECIALLY HIGH WHEN THESE ISLANDS BEAR PERMANENT HUMAN POPULATIONS OR ARE SUBJECTED TO REGULAR OR INTERMITTENT FISHING. SINCE THE LATE 1970'S, BRAZIL HAS BEEN ESTABLISHING MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS) AROUND ITS FOUR OCEANIC ISLAND GROUPS, WHICH CONCENTRATE HIGH ENDEMISM LEVELS AND ARE CONSIDERED PERIPHERAL OUTPOSTS OF THE BRAZILIAN BIOGEOGRAPHIC PROVINCE. IN 2018, THE BRAZILIAN LEGALLY MARINE PROTECTED AREA INCREASED > 10-FOLD, BUT MOST OF THE SIMILAR TO 1,000,000 KM(2) OF MPAS AROUND BRAZIL'S OCEANIC ISLANDS ARE STILL UNKNOWN AND UNPROTECTED.

MAXWELL WGH,1970,BULL GEOL SOC AM,GREAT BARRIER REEF: REGIONAL VARIATION IN A TERRIGENOUS-CARBONATE PROVINCE,NA,"THE GREAT BARRIER REEF PROVINCE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER CARBONATE AREAS BY (1) VERY EXTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF SHELF REEFS, (2) WIDESPREAD TERRIGENOUS FACIES, AND (3) A RELATIVELY DEEP SHELF WITH FREE WATER CIRCULATION. THE PROVINCE OCCUPIES 100,000 SQ MI OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF AND VARIES IN WIDTH FROM 180 MI IN THE SOUTH TO 10 MI AT LATITUDE 14 S. REGIONAL DEEPENING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, TOGETHER WITH REGIONAL VARIATION IN REEF MORPHOLOGY, PERMITS DIVISION OF THE PROVINCE INTO NORTHERN, CENTRAL, AND SOUTHERN REGIONS, WITH BOUNDARIES AT 16 S., AND 20 TO 21 S. GEOLOGICALLY, THE SHELF IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE TASMAN GEOSYNCLINAL BELT, CONSISTING OF SUBMERIDIONAL BASINS AND HIGHS. MAIN REEF DEVELOPMENT HAS OCCURRED ALONG THE TECTONIC HIGHS. PROLIFIC REEF GROWTH IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN REGIONS IS ENHANCED BY OCEANIC CURRENTS IMPINGING DIRECTLY ON THE SHELF, WHEREAS IN THE CENTRAL REGION, SPARSE GROWTH RESULTS PARTLY FROM LESS EFFECTIVE OCEANIC CIRCULATION AND PARTLY FROM WEAKER TIDAL ACTIVITY. LOCAL HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS INFLUENCE REEF MORPHOLOGY, SINCE REEFS EXPAND IN DIRECTIONS WHERE WATER (AND SUBSTRATE) CONDITIONS ARE MOST FAVORABLE. REEFS VARY IN FORM FROM CONCENTRIC PLATFORM REEFS WITH SHALLOW LAGOONS TO LINEAR REEFS WHICH TEND TO RECURVE AT THE ENDS, ULTIMATELY FORMING CLOSED RING REEFS, SIMILAR TO PLATFORM REEFS BUT CHARACTERIZED BY DEEP LAGOONS. ""RESORBED"" REEFS ARE FOUND IN AREAS OF UNFAVORABLE WATER CONDITIONS. THE NORTHERN REGION IS DOMINATED BY LINEAR SHELF-EDGE REEFS, THE CENTRAL REGION BY PLATFORM AND RESORBED REEFS AND THE SOUTHERN REGION BY A MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF LAGOONAL AND ELONGATE PLATFORM REEFS AND RING REEFS. THE REGIONAL FACIES PATTERN REFLECTS A WESTERN TERRIGENOUS SOURCE, AN EASTERN CARBONATE SOURCE, AND A CENTRAL SHELF ZONE WHICH SHOWS MINOR INFLUENCE FROM EITHER SOURCE. LOCAL DIVERGENCE FROM THIS IS CAUSED BY VARIATION IN (1) SHELF WIDTH AND DEPTH, (2) RATE OF SUPPLY AND TYPE OF MATERIAL DELIVERED TO THE SHELF, AND (3) AGE AND HISTORY OF THE LOCAL AREA. THUS, IN THE SOUTHERN REGION WHERE THE WIDE SHELF HAS A DEEP AXIAL TROUGH, A POOR SOURCE OF TERRIGENOUS SEDIMENTS, AND A MASSIVE SOURCE OF CARBONATE, THE FACIES PATTERN IS CHARACTERIZED BY A BAND OF NEARSHORE COARSE, RELICT, TERRIGENOUS SANDS, AN AXIAL ZONE OF MODERN TERRIGENOUS MUDS AND A MARGINAL SHELF WITH HIGH CARBONATE (80 PERCENT) SEDIMENTS. IN THE NORTHERN REGION, THE SHELF IS NARROW AND HAS A RELATIVELY STRONG TERRIGENOUS SOURCE; COARSE, COASTAL TERRIGENOUS SANDS ARE FOLLOWED SEAWARD BY A WEDGE OF TERRIGENOUS MUDS PROGRADING OVER COARSE RELICT QUARTZ SANDS WHICH OCCUR WITHIN ONE MILE OF INDIVIDUAL REEFS; INTER-REEF SEDIMENTS CONTAIN BOTH FINE TERRIGENOUS AND CARBONATE COMPONENTS. IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF PROVINCE, CONTEMPORARY DISPERSAL PROCESSES APPEAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE, AND THERE IS A GENERAL LACK OF ACCUMULATION OF MODERN SEDIMENT OVER MOST OF THE SHELF. SUBSTANTIAL MODERN DEPOSITION IS REPRESENTED ONLY BY TERRIGENOUS MUDS ADJACENT TO THE COAST IN THE NORTH AND IN THE AXIAL SHELF AREA IN THE SOUTH, AND BY CARBONATE SEDIMENTS ON ACTIVELY FORMING REEFS, IN LOCALIZED AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC REEFS, AND IN MAJOR INTER-REEF PASSAGES. ELSEWHERE, DEPOSITION IS LIMITED. THIS PATTERN PROBABLY WILL REMAIN STABLE UNTIL ADVENT OF A REGRESSIVE SEA-LEVEL PHASE. MARKED PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF PROVINCE AND THE FLORIDA-BAHAMAS PROVINCE. IN THE BAHAMAS, DIVERSE GRAIN TYPES REFLECT LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION; IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF PROVINCE, CARBONATE GRAINS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY OF SKELETAL ORIGIN AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCES ARE REFLECTED IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF DIFFERENT SKELETAL ELEMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SEDIMENT TEXTURE AND COMPOSITION AS WELL AS REEF DISTRIBUTION IN BOTH AREAS REFLECT PRIMARY HYDROLOGIC CONTROL.

FROM THESE MODELS, DESCRIPTIVE TERRAIN PARAMETERS WERE CALCULATED FOR EACH REEF, INCLUDING SLOPE, ASPECT, CURVATURE, RUGOSITY AND RUGGEDNESS. RESULTS SHOW THAT ALL REEFS ARE PREDOMINANTLY NORTHEAST-SOUTHWEST ORIENTED, WITH WELL-DEFINED LEEWARD AND WINDWARD SIDES. FOR THE THREE SUBMERGED BANK REEFS, STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY INCREASED WITH DEPTH. ESTIMATED MEAN RUGGEDNESS AND RUGOSITY WERE HIGHEST AT 20-40 M DEPTH RANGE ON WINDWARD SIDE SLOPES.

WE FOUND THAT AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS (>30 M), SOUTHERN REEFS BASEMENTS FROM TWO DISTINCT REEFS MERGE TO FORM A CONTINUOUS COMPLEX. THIS HAS IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS SINCE PRESENTLY, ONLY 28.7\% OF THIS REEF COMPLEX (MOSTLY SHALLOW AREAS) ARE WITHIN THE EXISTING LIMITS OF THE MARINE PARK'S CORE ZONE.

THE COMMUNITIES OF ECHINODERMS OBSERVED AT THESE DEPTHS MARKEDLY DIFFERED FROM THOSE REPORTED FOR SHALLOWER WATERS NEAR EASTER ISLAND. OF THE 20MORPHOSPECIES REPORTED IN THE PRESENT STUDY, ONLY 5 WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE EIE. ONE SPECIES, SIX GENERA, AND THREE FAMILIES WERE REPORTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS AREA, AND TWO NEW GENERA WERE DISCOVERED AND DESCRIBED. A PRELIMINARY BIOGEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS SUGGESTS AFFINITIES BETWEEN THE OBSERVED ECHINODERMS AND THOSE OF THE WEST PACIFIC.

BECAUSE DEEP REEFS ARE AMONG THE MOST UNDERSTUDIED HABITATS ON EARTH, FORMAL TESTS OF THE DRRH REMAIN SCARCE. IF THE DRRH IS VALID AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, THE DIVERSITY OF SPECIES, FUNCTIONS, AND LINEAGES OF FISH COMMUNITIES OF SHALLOW REEFS SHOULD BE ENCAPSULATED IN DEEP REEFS. WE TESTED THE DRRH BY ASSESSING THE TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL, AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY OF 22 BRAZILIAN FISH COMMUNITIES BETWEEN 2 AND 62 M DEPTH. WE PARTITIONED THE GAMMA DIVERSITY OF SHALLOW (<30 M) AND DEEP REEFS (>30 M) INTO INDEPENDENT ALPHA AND BETA COMPONENTS, ACCOUNTED FOR SPECIES' ABUNDANCE, AND ASSESSED WHETHER BETA PATTERNS WERE MOSTLY DRIVEN BY SPATIAL TURNOVER OR NESTEDNESS. WE RECORDED 3,821 FISHES BELONGING TO 85 SPECIES AND 36 FAMILIES. CONTRARY TO DRRH EXPECTATIONS, ONLY 48\% OF THE SPECIES OCCURRED IN BOTH SHALLOW AND DEEP REEFS. ALPHA DIVERSITY OF RARE SPECIES WAS HIGHER IN DEEP REEFS AS EXPECTED, BUT ALPHA DIVERSITY OF TYPICAL AND DOMINANT SPECIES DID NOT VARY WITH DEPTH. ALPHA FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY WAS HIGHER IN DEEP REEFS ONLY FOR RARE AND TYPICAL SPECIES, BUT NOT FOR DOMINANT SPECIES. ALPHA PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY WAS CONSISTENTLY HIGHER IN DEEP REEFS, SUPPORTING DRRH EXPECTATIONS. PROFILES OF TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL, AND PHYLOGENETIC BETA DIVERSITY INDICATED THAT DEEP REEFS WERE NOT MORE HETEROGENEOUS THAN SHALLOW REEFS, CONTRADICTING EXPECTATIONS OF BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION NEAR SEA SURFACE. FURTHERMORE, PAIRWISE BETA-DIVERSITY ANALYSES REVEALED THAT THE PATTERNS WERE MOSTLY DRIVEN BY SPATIAL TURNOVER RATHER THAN NESTEDNESS AT ANY DEPTH. CONCLUSIONS. ALTHOUGH SOME RESULTS SUPPORT THE DRRH, MOST INDICATE THAT THE SHALLOW-WATER REEF FISH DIVERSITY IS NOT FULLY ENCAPSULATED IN DEEP REEFS.

IN ADDITION, SCUBA-DIVING INVESTIGATIONS FROM A SELECTED SITE RESULTED IN DEFINING CORAL COMPOSITION AND COVER RATE. SIX DISTINCT FORE-REEF SECTORS WERE MORPHOLOGICALLY DIFFERENTIATED ON THE BASIS OF SEAWARD EXTENSION AND SLOPE GRADIENT. ONLY THE NORTH END, AND A RESTRICTED AREA OF THE MID-SOUTH-EAST SIDE EXTEND SEAWARDS OVER AN AVERAGE DISTANCE OF 150 M, WITH A RELATIVELY LOW GRADIENT (23 DEGREES-38 DEGREES). MOST OF THE OUTER-SLOPE AREAS ARE NARROW (< 100 M ON AVERAGE) AND STEEP (AVERAGE SLOPE EQUALS TO 45 DEGREES TO UP TO 70 DEGREES). GEOMORPHIC FEATURES INCLUDE SPUR-AND-GROOVE SYSTEMS, SUB-HORIZONTAL TO GENTLY DIPPING TERRACES (23-45 M WIDE) ENDING SEAWARDS IN VERTICAL STEPS (< 10 M HIGH) AND DROP-OFFS (> 10 M HIGH), OUTER-REEF CREST-LIKE RELIEFS (0.5 M-1.5 M HIGH), PINNACLES (2 M-17 M HIGH), CORAL HEADS (< 2 M HIGH), TRENCHS AND CONCAVE SCARS. THE RECOGNIZED SEVEN TERRACE LEVELS OCCUR AT THE RESPECTIVE DEPTHS OF ABOUT -5 M, -10 M, -15 M, -20 M, -24 M, -30.5 M AND -38 M. BASED ON COMPARISON WITH SUBSURFACE CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHY OF DRILLED REEF SEQUENCES FROM SOME OTHER PACIFIC ATOLLS, THE TERRACES ARE INTERPRETED AS REMNANTS OF REEF TRACTS FORMED DURING PLEISTOCENE INTERGLACIAL, HIGH SEA-STANDS, RESPECTIVELY DURING MIS SUBSTAGE 5E (ABOUT -125 KA), MIS SUBSTAGES 7A (ABOUT -195 KA), 7C (ABOUT -210 KA), 7E (ABOUT -240 KA) AND 9E (-330 KA). AFTER DEPTH CORRECTION OF GROUND LOWERING DURING PERIODS OF EMERGENCE AND SUBSIDENCE EFFECTS, TERRACE ELEVATIONS WERE EXPECTED TO INDICATE EUSTATIC SEA-LEVEL POSITIONS AT EACH IDENTIFIED HIGH SEA-STAND, AT APPROXIMATELY 7 M (MIS 5E) AND 2.2 M (MIS 7A) ABOVE PRESENT SEA LEVEL AND 9.5 M (MIS 7C), 11 M (MIS 7E) AND 8.6 M (MIS 9E) BELOW PRESENT SEA LEVEL. DURING THE POST-GLACIAL SEA-LEVEL RISE, FROM ABOUT 9.5 KY, THE STUDIED PORTIONS OF FORE-REEF SLOPES WERE RE-FLOODED. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT CORALGAL DEPOSITS IN THE FORM OF THIN VENEERS, CORAL HEADS, OUTER-REEF CREST-LIKE RELIEFS AND PINNACLES HAVE SIMPLY OVERLAPPED PRE-EXISTING STRUCTURES. LOCALLY, THE FORE-REEF ZONES ARE CARVED BY TRENCHS, I.E. INCIPIENT DETACHMENT FAULTS, AND SCARS, I.E. IMPRINTS OF FORMER LANDSLIDES. SIMILARLY, SOME DROP-OFFS MAY BE REGARDED AS FAULT WALLS.

ANALYSIS OF LIVE CORAL COVER DATA FROM 1997 TO 2019 IN SHALLOW (5 M DEPTH) REEFS OF THE MALDIVES SHOWED THAT THE 1998 HEAT WAVE CAUSED MORE THAN 90\% OF CORAL MORTALITY LEAVING ONLY 6.8 +/- 0.3\% OF SURVIVED CORALS IN ALL THE SHALLOW REEFS INVESTIGATED. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CORAL MORTALITY WAS OBSERVED AMONG ATOLLS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HUMAN PRESSURE. MALDIVIAN REEFS NEEDED 16 YEARS TO RECOVER TO THE PRE-BLEACHING HARD CORAL COVER VALUES. THE 2016 HEAT WAVE AFFECTED ALL REEFS INVESTIGATED, BUT REEFS IN ATOLLS WITH HIGHER HUMAN PRESSURE SHOWED GREATER CORAL MORTALITY THAN REEFS IN ATOLLS WITH LOWER HUMAN PRESSURE. ADDITIONALLY, EXPOSED (OCEAN) REEFS SHOWED LOWER CORAL MORTALITY THAN THOSE IN SHELTERED (LAGOON) REEFS. THE REDUCED CORAL MORTALITY IN 2016 AS COMPARED TO 1998 MAY PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT TO THE ADAPTIVE BLEACHING HYPOTHESIS (ABH) IN SHALLOW MALDIVIAN REEFS, BUT INTENSITY AND DURATION OF THE TWO HEAT WAVES WERE DIFFERENT. ANALYSIS OF CORAL COVER DATA COLLECTED ALONG DEPTH PROFILES ON THE OCEAN SIDES OF ATOLLS, FROM 10 TO 50 M, ALLOWED THE COMPARISON OF CORAL MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS TO DISCUSS THE DEEP REFUGE HYPOTHESIS (DRH). IN THE UPPER MESOPHOTIC ZONE (I.E., BETWEEN 30 AND 50 M), CORAL MORTALITY AFTER BLEACHING WAS NEGLIGIBLE. HOWEVER, LIVE CORAL COVER DID NOT EXCEED 15\%, A VALUE LOWER THAN CORAL SURVIVAL IN SHALLOW REEFS. LOW COVER VALUES OF CORALS SURVIVING IN THE MESOPHOTIC REEFS SUGGEST THAT THEIR ROLE AS REFUGE OR SEED BANKS FOR THE FUTURE RECOVERY OF SOME SPECIES IN SHALLOW-WATER REEFS OF THE MALDIVES MAY BE SMALL. THE REPEATEDLY HIGH CORAL MORTALITY AFTER BLEACHING EVENTS AND THE LONG RECOVERY PERIOD, ESPECIALLY IN SITES WITH HUMAN PRESSURE, SUGGEST THAT THE FORESEEN INCREASED FREQUENCY OF BLEACHING EVENTS WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE FUTURE OF MALDIVIAN REEFS, AND ASK FOR REDUCING LOCAL PRESSURES TO IMPROVE THEIR RESILIENCE.",10.3389/fmars.2020.00587,MONTEFALCONE M_2020_FRONT MAR SCI,,,,,,,

UNTIL RECENTLY, LITTLE WAS KNOWN ABOUT THESE DEEPER AND MORE INACCESSIBLE REEFS. THE MESOPHOTIC CORAL-REEF HABITATS (20-80 M) WERE A MAJOR RESERVOIR OF MARINE BIODIVERSITY, WITH UNIQUE AND EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH FISH DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE. SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE STUDY REGION WAS 1.4 TIMES, AND ABUNDANCE ALMOST TWICE, THAT RECORDED FOR SIMILAR MESOPHOTIC HABITATS ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA. A REVIEW OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE REVEALED THAT AUSTRALIA'S NW OCEANIC SHOALS SUPPORT THE HIGHEST FISH SPECIES RICHNESS REPORTED FOR MESOPHOTIC REEFS TO DATE. WE MADE REGIONAL COMPARISONS OF FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE (SPECIES COMPOSITION, RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE) AND ASSESSED THE INFLUENCE OF DEPTH, SUBSTRATE AND LOCATION. THE PRESENCE OF CONSOLIDATED CALCAREOUS REEF, DEPTH AND ASPECT (A SURROGATE FOR EXPOSURE) HAD THE GREATEST INFLUENCE ON SPECIES RICHNESS. IN CONTRAST, ASPECT AND THE PRESENCE OF BENTHIC BIOTA HAD THE GREATEST INFLUENCE ON FISH ABUNDANCE. SITES MOST EXPOSED TO THE PREVAILING CURRENTS (FACING NORTH-EAST) HAD LOWEST FISH ABUNDANCE, WHILE HIGHEST ABUNDANCES WERE RECORDED ON MODERATELY EXPOSED SITES (ALONG THE NORTH-WEST AND SOUTHEAST EDGES). THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES WERE SMALL (POTNACENTRUS COELESTIS) AND LARGE (NASO HEXACANTHUS) PLANKTIVOROUS FISH. CURRENTLY, 29.3\% OF NE AUSTRALIA MESOPHOTIC REEFS ARE WITHIN NO-TAKE MANAGEMENT ZONES OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. IN CONTRAST, JUST 1.3\% OF THE NW OCEANIC SHOALS ARE DESIGNATED AS NO-TAKE AREAS. THE LOCATION AND EXTENT OF MESOPHOTIC REEFS REMAIN POORLY QUANTIFIED GLOBALLY.

WE SAMPLED 19 BRAZILIAN REEFS DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN 3 AND 61 M DEPTH AND TESTED FIVE DRRH PREDICTIONS REGARDING SPECIES DIVERSITY, DISTRIBUTION, AND FUNCTIONAL PROFILE OF COMMUNITIES. THE FIRST PREDICTION WAS THAT DEEP REEFS (>30 M DEPTH) SHOULD HOST GREATER GAMMA DIVERSITY TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT SPECIES TO SHALLOW REEFS (<30 M). SECOND, DEPTH-GENERALIST SPECIES SHOULD DOMINATE THE SHALLOW REEFS; OTHERWISE, LOCAL EXTIRPATION IN SHALLOW AREAS COULD NOT BE REVERTED BY THE DEEP REEFS. THIRD, ALPHA DIVERSITY SHOULD BE GREATER IN DEEP REEFS DUE TO REDUCED ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURE IN DEEPER AREAS. FOURTH, BETA DIVERSITY SHOULD BE SMALLER AMONG SHALLOW THAN DEEP REEFS DUE TO THE HUMAN-INDUCED SPREAD OF A FEW DISTURBANCE-ADAPTED SPECIES NEAR SEA SURFACE. FINALLY, THE FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF SHALLOW REEFS SHOULD BE A SUBSET FROM THAT OF DEEP REEFS TO ALLOW FUNCTIONAL RECOVERING OF SHALLOWER AREAS. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, CORAL COMMUNITIES PRESENTED TWICE MORE GAMMA DIVERSITY IN SHALLOW THAN DEEP REEFS (13 VS. SEVEN EFFECTIVE SPECIES) AND ONLY THREE OUT OF 17 SPECIES OCCURRED ALONG THE ENTIRE GRADIENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE ALPHA DIVERSITY OF RARE, TYPICAL, AND DOMINANT SPECIES WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN SHALLOW AND DEEP REEFS, AND THE BETA DIVERSITY OF RARE AND TYPICAL SPECIES WAS ABOUT 50\% GREATER IN SHALLOW THAN DEEP REEFS. SUPPORTING THE DRRH, CORAL COMMUNITIES OF BOTH REEFS WERE DOMINATED BY REEF-BUILDING, ZOOXANTHELLATED, GONOCHORIC CORALS WITH BROODING OR BROADCAST REPRODUCTIVE MODE (SIDERASTREA STELLATA AND MONTASTRAEA CAVERNOSA). HOWEVER, SOFT CORALS WERE OBSERVED ONLY IN SHALLOW REEFS AND AZOOXANTHELLATED CORALS WERE RECORDED ONLY IN DEEP REEFS. THESE FINDINGS REVEALED A LIMITED POTENTIAL OF DEEP REEFS TO SERVE AS REFUGES FOR SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC CORAL COMMUNITIES, THOUGH THEY MAY WORK FOR TWO DEPTH-GENERALIST DOMINANT SPECIES.

Due to their depths (−30–−150 m), accessibility is challenging, and the structure of mesophotic fish assemblages is generally less known than either shallow reefs or deep zones with soft bottoms which are generally trawled. Environmental DNA metabarcoding from seawater filtered in situ could improve our ability to monitor the diversity of mesophotic ecosystems. Here, we developed and tested a submersible standalone pumping device allowing targeted marine water filtering to explore the biodiversity of two mesophotic ecosystems, one temperate along the Provence coast in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea and one tropical at the seamount La Pérouse in the Western Indian Ocean. We filtered water samples from depths ranging between 0 and 200 m in the Mediterranean Sea and between 60 and 140 m in the Indian Ocean and applied a metabarcoding protocol using the teleo primer pair targeting the 12S mitochondrial rDNA (Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes). For both study regions, our eDNA surveys were able to recover highly diverse fish assemblages, and the compositional analysis of eDNA samples showed both a marked signal of fish compositional turnover and overlapping taxa between depth zones. Further, we observed that a substantial number of species were found in samples collected in depths beyond their reported depth range suggesting an underestimation of species' depth tolerances. eDNA metabarcoding should thus complement existing knowledge of species' geographic distributions across space and depth. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of eDNA metabarcoding for future mesophotic surveys as it allows fast and broad biodiversity assessment.",10.1002/edn3.358,MUFF M_2023_ENVIRON DNA,,,,,,,

THE MOST PROMINENT REEFS ARE LOCATED IN THE ABROLHOS BANK, A 46,000 KM2 EXTENSION OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SHELF. HOWEVER, JUST 100 KM NORTH OF ABROLHOS IS THE ROYAL CHARLOTTE BANK (RCB), AN AREA STILL POORLY INVESTIGATED. FROM A BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE ONLY SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AVAILABLE IS THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF LOBSTER FISHERIES IN THE REGION. HENCE, WE PERFORMED AN EXPEDITION TO INVESTIGATE WHAT MACROHABITATS ARE FOUND IN THE RCB AND PERFORM A PRELIMINARY BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT. A DROPCAM WAS DEPLOYED IN 67 SITES AND RECORDED IMAGES OF MACROHABITATS AND ASSOCIATED BIODIVERSITY. FOUR DIFFERENT MACROHABITATS WERE DETECTED: RHODOLITH BEDS, MACROALGAL FORESTS ASSOCIATED WITH RHODOLITH BEDS, CALCAREOUS SAND DEPOSITS AND CORAL REEFS. THE FORMER TWO WERE THE MOST FREQUENT, AND BOTH RHODOLITH AND MACROALGAE DENSITIES WERE HIGHER ON THE OUTER SHELF. A TOTAL OF 83 SPECIES OF FISH, INVERTEBRATES AND ALGAE WERE IDENTIFIED, WHICH COMPRISES A COMPARATIVELY HIGH DIVERSITY FOR VISUAL REEF BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENTS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE RCB IS A LARGE AND DIVERSE ECOSYSTEM COMPLEX MOSTLY COMPOSED OF RHODOLITHS, AND ALSO THAT IT MAY BE ALREADY UNDERGOING ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND FISHERIES. THEREFORE, FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF BIODIVERSITY AND ITS MAIN THREATS AND EVALUATE THE POSSIBLE NEED OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES.",10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107363,NEGRAO F_2021_ESTUAR COAST SHELF SCI,,,,,,,

THIS PAPER PROVIDES DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF AGGREGATION FORMATION AND MASS SPAWNING OF THE BERMUDA CHUB (KYPHOSUS SECTATRIX). SPAWNING COLORATION AND GAMETE RELEASE OF K. SECTATRIX WERE OBSERVED AND FILMED AT THE GRAMMANIK BANK, A DEEP SPAWNING AGGREGATION SITE USED BY MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES LOCATED ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE PUERTO RICAN SHELF 10 KM SOUTH OF ST. THOMAS, US VIRGIN ISLANDS. UNDERWATER VISUAL SURVEYS USING TECHNICAL NITROX AND CLOSED CIRCUIT RE-BREATHERS WERE CONDUCTED FROM DECEMBER 2002 TO MARCH 2013 AND DOCUMENTED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF MOVEMENT AND AGGREGATION FORMATION ALONG 1.5 KM OF MESOPHOTIC REEF. THE LARGEST AGGREGATIONS OF K. SECTATRIX (> 200 FISH) WERE OBSERVED ON THE GRAMMANIK BANK JANUARY TO MARCH FROM 0 TO 11 D AFTER THE FULL MOON WITH PEAK ABUNDANCE FROM 60 TO 80 D AFTER THE WINTER SOLSTICE ACROSS ALL SURVEY YEARS. AGGREGATION FORMATION OF K. SECTATRIX COINCIDED WITH THE SPAWNING SEASON OF NASSAU (EPINEPHELUS STRIATUS) AND YELLOWFIN (MYCTEROPERCA VENENOSA) GROUPERS. THESE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF AGGREGATION FORMATION AND SPAWNING SUGGEST THAT K. SECTATRIX, AN HERBIVORE, MAY ALSO BE A TRANSIENT AGGREGATING SPECIES. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, CHUBS WERE OBSERVED BOTH PAIR SPAWNING AND MASS SPAWNING. COLOR PATTERNS AND BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH AGGREGATION AND SPAWNING ARE DESCRIBED AND COMPARED TO SPAWNING CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED IN OTHER SPECIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE SIMILAR BUT OTHERS THAT APPEAR UNIQUE TO K.

TWO TYPES OF CORAL BLEACHING HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; THE FIRST IS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH MASS CORAL BLEACHING EVENTS; THE SECOND IS A SEASONAL LOSS OF ALGAE AND/OR PIGMENTS. HERE, WE DESCRIBE A PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN WITNESSED FOR REPEATED SUMMERS IN THE MESOPHOTIC ZONE (40-63 M) IN THE NORTHERN RED SEA: SEASONAL BLEACHING AND RECOVERY OF SEVERAL HERMATYPIC CORAL SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE FOLLOWED THE RECURRING BLEACHING PROCESS OF THE COMMON CORAL STYLOPHORA PISTILLATA. BLEACHING OCCURRED FROM APRIL TO SEPTEMBER WITH A 66\% DECLINE IN CHLOROPHYLL A CONCENTRATION, WHILE RECOVERY BEGAN IN OCTOBER. USING AQUARIUM AND TRANSPLANTATION EXPERIMENTS, WE EXPLORED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE, PHOTON FLUX DENSITY AND HETEROTROPHIC FOOD AVAILABILITY.

METABARCODING ANALYSES OF AMPLICONS SHOWED THAT EXCEPT FOR ONE SITE, CORAL-SPECIFIC EDNA FROM APPROXIMATELY 0.5 L SEAWATER SAMPLES WAS SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY GENERA. THE PROPORTION OF ACROPORA EDNA WAS HIGHER AT SHALLOW REEFS AND UPPER RIDGES OF SLOPES, WHILE THE PROPORTION OF PORITES INCREASED AT MESOPHOTIC SITES.

HERE, WE PROPOSE A SEAFLOOR OBSERVATION METHOD USING A LOW-COST AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE (AUV). THIS METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO EASILY PERFORM UNDERWATER OBSERVATIONS OF MCES, AND IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO GENERAL SEAFLOOR SURVEYS, SUCH AS UNDERWATER ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES, HYDROTHERMAL VENT FIELDS, ETC. THE METHOD POSSESSES THREE IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE SURVEYS. FIRST, IT CAN BE APPLIED IN HIGHLY RUGGED TERRAINS AND ENABLES THE AUV TO TRACK OMNIDIRECTIONAL SURFACES AT HIGH SPEED (MAX. SIMILAR TO 1 M/S). SECOND, IT CAN PRODUCE A RELIABLE THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) IMAGE OF THE SEAFLOOR BASED ON A DEPTH SENSOR. THIRD, IT CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE FLOW VELOCITY FIELD. THE PROPOSED METHOD WAS TESTED BY USING THE AUV HATTORI- 2, WHICH IS A LIGHTWEIGHT, ONE- MAN PORTABLE AUV EQUIPPED WITH COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF SENSORS.

ACCESSIBILITY TO THESE ECOSYSTEMS IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THEIR DEPTH LIMITS (SIMILAR TO 30 - 150 M) AND AS A RESULT, SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THESE REEF SYSTEMS IS LIMITED. IT HAS BEEN POSITED THAT THE DEPTH LIMITS OF MCES DIMINISH ANTHROPOGENIC EFFECTS EXPERIENCED BY SHALLOW REEF SYSTEMS. A LACK OF EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENTS TO DATE HAS MADE THIS HYPOTHESIS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE FOR MESOPHOTIC REEF METABOLISM. THE ALKALINITY ANOMALY TECHNIQUE WAS UTILIZED TO DETERMINE RATES OF NET ECOSYSTEM CALCIFICATION (NEC) AND NET ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTION (NEP) FROM 30, 40 AND 60 M MESOPHOTIC REEFS DURING A 15-MONTH PERIOD. SEAWATER CHEMISTRY WAS DETERMINED TO BE CHEMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR CALCIFICATION (AVERAGE ARAGONITE SATURATION OMEGA(ARAGONITE) OF 3.58, AVERAGE CALCITE SATURATION OMEGA(CALCITE) OF 5.44) WITH ESTIMATES OF NEC INDICATING THESE REEF SYSTEMS WERE NET ACCRETIVE AND WITHIN GLOBAL AVERAGE VALUES FOR SHALLOW CORAL REEFS (< 30 M). THE STRONGEST PERIODS OF CALCIFICATION OCCURRED IN LATE SUMMER AND WERE COUPLED WITH STRONG AUTOTROPHIC SIGNALS. THESE EPISODES WERE FOLLOWED BY SUPPRESSED CALCIFICATION AND AUTOTROPHY AND IN THE CASE OF THE 60 M REEFS, A SWITCH TO HETEROTROPHY. WHILST THERE WAS VARIABILITY BETWEEN THE THREE REEFS DEPTHS, THE OVERALL STATUS OF THE MESOPHOTIC SYSTEM WAS NET AUTOTROPHIC. THIS DETERMINATION WAS THE OPPOSITE OF TROPHIC STATUS ESTIMATES PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED FOR ADJACENT SHALLOW REEFS. WHILST THERE WERE PERIODS OF NET DISSOLUTION, THE MESOPHOTIC REEF SYSTEM WAS NET ACCRETIVE (I.E., GROSS CALCIFICATION > GROSS CACO3 DISSOLUTION). THE MEASURED INORGANIC CARBON CHEMISTRY AND ESTIMATES OF NEC AND NEP REPRESENT THE FIRST SUCH BIOGEOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS FOR MCES. THE VALUES ESTABLISHED BY THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATE JUST HOW CLOSE THESE UNDERSTUDIED ECOSYSTEMS ARE IN TERMS OF THE KNOWN BOUNDARY THRESHOLDS FOR LOW SATURATION STATE REEFS.

THE SHELF-EDGE REEFS SUPPORT IMPORTANT MULTI-SPECIES FISHERIES AND HARBOUR CRITICAL HABITATS FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF MANY REEF FISH SPECIES, INCLUDING SPAWNING AGGREGATION SITES THAT ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO HUMAN PRESSURES, SUCH AS INTENSIVE FISHING, SHIPPING AND OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS EXPLOITATION; ALL ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY EXPANDING OFF THE BRAZILIAN COAST. 7. RESULTS REVEAL THE BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF DEEP SHELF-EDGE REEFS AS A CRITICAL ECOLOGICAL AREA. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE, SHELF EDGE REEFS ARE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN ANY MARINE PROTECTED AREA NETWORK IN THE TROPICAL SOUTH-WESTERN ATLANTIC. THERE IS NOW AN URGENT NEED TO ENHANCE KNOWLEDGE, IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND CONSIDER THESE DEEPER HABITATS AS PRIORITY AREAS FOR CONSERVATION.

SHELF-INCISED VALLEYS AND OTHER PROMINENT MESO-SCALE STRUCTURES SUCH AS REEFS AND SINKHOLES HAVE A GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE DISCRIMINATION OF BENTHIC HABITAT GROUPS. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE SHELF-INCISED VALLEYS AS A MESOPHOTIC HABITAT, BY FOCUSING ON THEIR GEOMORPHOLOGICAL CONTROL IN DEFINING DISTINCT HABITATS IN COMPARISON WITH THE FLAT SURROUNDING AREA. THE STUDY WAS BASED ON THE INTEGRATION OF HIGH-RESOLUTION BATHYMETRY DATA (MULTIBEAM ECHOSOUNDER), VIDEO IMAGING, AND PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF THE WATER COLUMN. HABITAT MAPPING WAS CONDUCTED USING OBJECT-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS SEGMENTATION AND CLUSTERING. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ASSESS THE VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH HABITAT DISTRIBUTION AT EACH MORPHOLOGICAL REGION OF THE VALLEYS. BATHYMETRIC DATA REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF 5 SHELF-INCISED VALLEYS AND 5 SEABED CLASSES WERE DEFINED AS CARBONATE CRUSTS, RHODOLITHS (3 DISTINCT CLASSES) AND UNCONSOLIDATED SEDIMENTS. A COMPREHENSIVE HABITAT MAP WITH 17 CLASSES WAS PRODUCED, AND 13 ARE ASSOCIATED WITH VALLEY \& PRIME;S RELIEF. EXTENSIVE RHODOLITH BEDS WERE MAPPED IN THE VALLEY FLANKS/BOTTOM AND IN THE FLAT AREAS. SHELF-INCISED VALLEYS ARE PROMINENT MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES THAT ADD COMPLEXITY TO THE SEASCAPE, CONTRASTING WITH THE FLAT RELIEF THAT DOMINATES THE SEASCAPE. THE SEABED FOOTAGE OBTAINED IN THE VALLEYS REVEALED THAT THEIR HETEROGENEOUS, COMPLEX AND IRREGULAR TOPOGRAPHY HARBORS A GREAT DIVERSITY OF EPIBIONTS, SUCH AS SCLERACTINIAN CORALS, CORALLINE ALGAE, SPONGES AND BRYOZOANS. MOST OF THE VARIABILITY IN THE DATASET IS CORRELATED WITH SALINITY, TEMPERATURE AND CARBONATE SEDIMENTS, WHICH SEEM TO BE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VARIABLES OVER THE BIOLOGICAL ASSEMBLAGE, TOGETHER WITH WATER DEPTH AND SEABED SLOPE. SHELF-INCISED VALLEYS, SIMILARLY TO SUBMARINE CANYONS, CAN DEFINE A COMPLEX MESOPHOTIC HABITAT AND SUSTAIN DISTINCT BIODIVERSITY, AND EVEN FORM MESOPHOTIC REEFS.

WE DEVELOPED A SET OF `ELECTRIC ROCKS' (ARTIFICIAL ROCKS FITTED WITH EVENT LOGGERS) TO RECORD THE DATE AND TIME OF ANY MOVEMENT. WE DEPLOYED THE ROCKS IN MULTIPLE CLUSTERS ON THE TERRACED SLOPE OF THE SEAL COLONY ATOLL (FRENCH FRIGATE SHOALS) CLOSE TO THE BEACH HAULOUT AND AT 2 SITES FURTHER AWAY ON THE SUMMITS OF NEIGHBORING BANKS. THE GOAL WAS TO EXPAND TEMPORAL MONITORING (DIURNALLY AND SEASONALLY) OF THE SEAL'S USE OF MESOPHOTIC RUBBLE PATCHES WITHOUT REQUIRING FURTHER INSTRUMENTATION OF MONK SEALS. THE DATA FROM THE ELECTRIC ROCKS SHOWED PATTERNS CONSISTENT WITH THE BEHAVIOR SEEN FROM THE SEAL-MOUNTED VIDEO, INCLUDING RAPID ROCK-TO-ROCK SEARCHING AND MORE MOVEMENTS CLOSER TO SEAL HAULOUTS. THE ELECTRIC ROCKS DETECTED MORE ROCK TIPS ON THE ATOLL TERRACE THAN ON THE BANKS, WITH HIGHER COUNTS SEEN DURING THE DAY AT THE BANK SUMMITS. SEASONALLY, BOTH THE TERRACE AND BANK DETECTED MORE MOVEMENTS IN SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS CONSISTENT WITH THE MONK SEAL'S REPRODUCTIVE PUPPING AND MOLTING SEASON THAN DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, SUGGESTING SOME SEASONAL CHANGE IN THE FORAGING HABITAT OF MONK SEALS.",10.3354/esr01259,PARRISH FA_2023_ENDANGER SPECIES RES,,,,,,,

NUMEROUS ASSESSMENTS, FROM MESOCOSM STUDIES TO ANALYSIS OF BIOPSIED TISSUE OR TISSUE SAMPLES FROM NECROPSIED ANIMALS, REVEALED A CONSTELLATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS RELATED TO DWH IMPACTS ON GOM BIOTA, SOME OF WHICH CLEARLY OR LIKELY RESULTED IN MORTALITY. WHILE THE ESTIMATED CONCENTRATIONS OF HYDROCARBONS IN SHELF WATERS AND SEDIMENTS WERE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN MEASURED IN INSHORE OR DEEP GOM ENVIRONMENTS, THE LEVEL OF MORTALITY OBSERVED OR PREDICTED WAS SUBSTANTIAL FOR MANY SHELF TAXA. IN SOME CASES, SUCH AS FOR ZOOPLANKTON, COMMUNITY SHIFTS FOLLOWING THE SPILL WERE EPHEMERAL, LIKELY REFLECTING HIGH RATES OF POPULATION TURNOVER AND PRODUCTIVITY. IN OTHER TAXA, SUCH AS GOM REEF FISHES, IMPACTS OF THE SPILL ARE CONFOUNDED WITH OTHER STRESSORS, SUCH AS FISHING MORTALITY OR THE APPEARANCE AND RAPID POPULATION GROWTH OF INVASIVE LIONFISH (PTEROIS SPP.).

OUR HIGH-RESOLUTION STRATIGRAPHIC AND TEMPORAL RECORDS OF BIOEROSION ACTIVITY ARE DEFINED AND COMPARED TO PUBLISHED MULTI-PROXY PALEOENVIRONMENTAL INTERPRETATIONS FROM THE EXP. 325 CORES. CORALGAL ASSEMBLAGES, GEOCHRONOLOGY AND LITHOLOGY ARE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTROLS ON THE MULTI-SCALE SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS OF BIOEROSION ACROSS AND ALONG THE GBR SHELF AND WITHIN INDIVIDUAL HOLES. NOGGIN PASS IS CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BIOEROSION ACTIVITY THAN HYDROGRAPHERS. AT EACH TRANSECT CHANGES IN BIOEROSION INTENSITY ARE OBSERVED TO BE COEVAL WITH SOME MAJOR REEF SEQUENCE BOUNDARIES, HOWEVER DUE TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED NATURE AND LIMITED RECOVERY MANY BOUNDARIES HAVE INCONCLUSIVE TRENDS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IS USED TO INTERPRET THE RELATIONSHIP OF BIOEROSION INTENSITY TO VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING PALEO-WATER DEPTH, LITHOLOGY, CORAL AND ALGAL ASSEMBLAGES, TRANSECT LOCATION, GEOMORPHIC FEATURE, VERTICAL ACCRETION AND REEF SEQUENCES. TERRIGENOUS SEDIMENT FLUSHING, DEPOSITIONAL REGIME AND A PRONOUNCED LATITUDINAL GRADIENT IN SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SIGNIFICANT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN BIOEROSION INTENSITY BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN TRANSECTS AND ALSO DURING REEF DEMISE. BIOEROSION AT BOTH TRANSECTS IS HIGHEST IN THE `PROTO-BARRIER' (REEF 4) SITES WHEN COMPARED TO ALL FRINGING TERRACE REEFS (REEF 3A, 3B AND 4).

THE SECOND METHOD HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR POTENTIAL ERRORS FROM IMAGE DISTORTION CAUSED BY VARIABLE CAMERA ANGLE RELATIVE TO THE SUBSTRATUM, BUT WITHOUT A BROADER COMPARISON OF BOTH METHODS. WE FIND THAT STUDIES THAT HAVE USED THE UUV-BASED METHOD ARE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, MOST IMPORTANTLY: (1) ACCESS TO THE FULL MESOPHOTIC ZONE, (2) HIGHER SAMPLE REPLICATION, AND (3) REDUCED LIKELIHOOD OF SAMPLING BIAS. FOR TECH DIVING SURVEYS CONDUCTED AT 91 M, I.E. THE DEEPEST DEPTH REPORTED USING THIS METHOD BUT ONLY MIDWAY THROUGH THE MESOPHOTIC ZONE, STUDIES HAVE REPORTED PARTICULARLY HIGH SPONGE COVER (SIMILAR TO 80 VS. < 10\% FOR UUV-BASED SURVEYS), WHICH MAY BE A CONSEQUENCE OF LOW REPLICATION AND TARGETED SAMPLING INFLUENCED BY VERY SHORT WORKING TIMES UNDER HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS. WHEN EVALUATING BENTHIC ABUNDANCE METRICS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS, ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABLE SUBSTRATUM ANGLE ARE COMMON TO ANY TOPOGRAPHICALLY COMPLEX SURFACE, PARTICULARLY WITHIN A QUADRAT. NEVERTHELESS, POINT-INTERCEPT ESTIMATES ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON QUADRAT AREA AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ERROR DUE TO IMAGE DISTORTION OR SURFACE COMPLEXITY.

SEVENTY-SEVEN PAPERS ON MCES RESEARCH WERE COMPILED IN THIS REVIEW, RECORDING A TOTAL OF 138 SPECIES.

THE VARIATION OF CORAL GENUS RICHNESS ACROSS THE DEPTH GRADIENT IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY A MID-DOMAIN EFFECT WITH A PEAK AT 40 M DEPTH. AT THE SAME TIME, WE FOUND THAT THE DIFFERENCES IN CORAL GENERA ACROSS ISLANDS (SPATIAL BETA-DIVERSITY) INCREASED STEADILY ALONG THE DEPTH GRADIENT. MAIN CONCLUSIONS OUR FINDINGS REPORT THE FIRST QUANTITATIVE RESULTS OF CORAL COVER AND DIVERSITY FROM MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS IN FRENCH POLYNESIA AND ALSO PRESENT ONE OF THE FEW EXISTING STUDIES TO EXAMINE THE BROAD BREADTH OF THE MESOPHOTIC DEPTH GRADIENT. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS CAN HOST UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH GENERIC RICHNESS OF SCLERACTINIAN CORAL ASSEMBLAGES. AT THE SAME TIME, WE SHOWED THAT INCREASING DEPTH INCREASES THE DIFFERENCES IN GENERIC DIVERSITY COMPOSITION ACROSS ISLANDS, WHEREAS SHALLOW REEFS ARE SIMILAR IN BETWEEN. WHILE A SINGLE ISLAND COULD CONSERVE SHALLOW REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY, MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS CONTAINING THE RICHEST DIVERSITY REQUIRE SITE-SPECIFIC MEASURES, SUGGESTING THAT CONSIDERING THESE MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS IN CONSERVATION IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN REGIONAL DIVERSITY.",10.1111/ddi.13549,PEREZ-ROSALES G_2022_DIVERS DISTRIB,,,,,,,

MANY MODERN TOOLS FOR THESE SURVEYS, SUCH AS REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES AND AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES, CAN CAPTURE THOUSANDS OF IMAGES IN A SINGLE DEPLOYMENT. TURNING THIS INTO QUANTITATIVE DATA TYPICALLY INVOLVES HUMAN ANNOTATION WHICH IS OFTEN TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY. PERCENT COVER OF ORGANISMS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON METRICS FOR MONITORING CHANGES IN ABUNDANCE, WHICH MAY BE ATTAINED THROUGH VISUAL ESTIMATION, DIGITIZATION, OR POINT-COUNT APPROACHES. HOWEVER, ALTERNATIVE METRICS OF ABUNDANCE SUCH AS DENSITY (DIRECT COUNTS) OR PRESENCE ABSENCE, AS WELL AS METRICS THAT QUANTIFY CONDITION (E.G., BLEACHING) AND SIZE-STRUCTURE CAN ALSO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FOR TRACKING CHANGE. UNDERSTANDING THE STATISTICAL POWER OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES IS CRITICAL TO DESIGNING EFFECTIVE IMAGE-BASED MONITORING PROGRAMS. GIVEN THE DIFFERING STATISTICAL POWER AND TIME TAKEN USING DIFFERENT APPROACHES, PROGRAM MANAGERS NEED TO DECIDE WHERE TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES. HERE WE USE BENTHIC IMAGERY FROM TWO LONG-TERM MONITORING SITES IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA TO ANNOTATE THREE EXAMPLE MORPHOSPECIES (MORPHOLOGICALLY DISTINCT ORGANISMS) USING THREE APPROACHES: POINT-COUNT (PERCENT COVER), FULL COUNT AND PRESENCE-ABSENCE WITHIN IMAGERY. ALSO, WE COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE POINT COUNT AND FULL COUNT APPROACHES FOR MONITORING BLEACHING IN ONE OF OUR MORPHOSPECIES. WE USE SPATIO-TEMPORAL MODELS TO QUANTIFY TRENDS IN THE EMPIRICAL DATA AND SIMULATIONS TO QUANTIFY THE POWER OF THESE APPROACHES TO DETECT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TEMPORAL CHANGE USING DIFFERENT SAMPLING EFFORTS (EITHER 100 OR 200 IMAGES). ADDITIONALLY, WE EXAMINE THE ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS THAT SIZE-STRUCTURE INFORMATION CAN PROVIDE FOR TWO MORPHOSPECIES. WE FIND THAT THE FULL COUNT APPROACH PROVIDES A HIGHER STATISTICAL POWER TO DETECT CHANGE THAN THE OTHER APPROACHES FOR OUR EXAMPLE MORPHOSPECIES, INCLUDING TRACKING BLEACHING STATUS. SIZE-STRUCTURE INFORMATION CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS SUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF RECRUITMENT OR MORTALITY EVENTS OR GROWTH OF INDIVIDUALS. WE RECOMMEND THAT MONITORING PROGRAMS USING BENTHIC IMAGERY SHOULD CONSIDER THE CHOICE OF ANNOTATION APPROACH AS THIS IS LIKELY TO IMPACT OBSERVED TEMPORAL PATTERNS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE FOCUS IS SPECIFIC INDICATOR SPECIES RATHER THAN TOTAL BIODIVERSITY.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109029,PERKINS N_2022_ECOL INDIC,,,,,,,

AS SPECIES EXTEND INTO NEW RANGES THEIR ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS AND THE NICHES THAT THEY OCCUPY MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE.

AUV TRANSECTS COVERING SIMILAR DEPTHS FROM BOTH THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA, AND FROM THE RANGE EXTENSION AREA OF THE EAST COAST OF TASMANIA WERE EXAMINED FOR THE PRESENCE OF BARRENS. WE FIND THAT C. RODGERSII OCCUPIES A DIFFERENT REALISED NICHE IN ITS EXTENDED RANGE, WITH BARRENS HABITAT OCCURRING SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPER IN TASMANIAN WATERS (16-58 M) COMPARED TO NSW WATERS (7-27 M). THE EXPANSION OF BARRENS HABITAT HAS DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY, WITH FLOW-ON EFFECTS TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND LOCAL FISHERIES, AND IN TASMANIA THIS THREAT EXTENDS TO DEEPER, INVERTEBRATE-DOMINATED HABITATS. THIS FINDING HAS IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS, IN PARTICULAR THE NEED TO INCORPORATE DEEPER REEF SYSTEMS INTO PLANNING, WITH INCREASED BARRENS EXPECTED UNDER FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTIONS. ONE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT APPROACH IS THE USE OF NO-TAKE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS) TO PREVENT BARREN ESTABLISHMENT IN REPRESENTATIVE HABITATS BY REBUILDING VIABLE POPULATIONS OF URCHIN PREDATORS. WE ALSO EXAMINE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MPA STATUS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF BARRENS WITHIN A SMALL, NO-TAKE TASMANIAN RESERVE AND ADJACENT CONTROL SITES.

THIS INFORMATION IS CRUCIAL FOR ISOLATING BACKGROUND ``NOISE'' FROM LONG-TERM ``SIGNALS''. HERE WE QUANTIFY COMPONENTS OF VARIANCE FOR FIVE KEY DEEP-WATER SESSILE INVERTEBRATE SPECIES ACROSS FOUR LONG-TERM BENTHIC MONITORING SITES IN A REGION UNDERGOING STRONG CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES. WE USE LINEAR MIXED MODELS TO ESTIMATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF SOURCES OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIANCE IN SPECIES COVERS FROM EMPIRICAL DATA. WE THEN COMBINE THIS INFORMATION WITH PROJECTED LONG-TERM CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES IN THE COVER OF THESE GROUPS AND TEST THE POWER OF VARIOUS SURVEY DESIGNS TO DETECT CHANGE THROUGH TIME. LARGE SHORT-TERM TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN THE COVER OF A GORGONIAN OCTOCORAL RESULTS IN HIGH COMPONENTS OF VARIANCE THAT LIMIT THE DETECTABILITY OF THE PROJECTED LONG-TERM TREND FOR THIS SPECIES. CONVERSELY, FOR THREE OF THE SPONGE SPECIES HIGH POWER IS ACHIEVABLE WITH REVISITS TO THE FOUR ORIGINAL SITES EVERY TWO YEARS UNTIL 2060.

REEFS ARE SELECTED FOR PALAEOBATHYMETRIC ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED BY IN SITU PRESERVATION OF BENTHIC COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE OFTEN DEPTH RELATED. IN ADDITION, IF THE REEF CREST AND SLOPE ARE PRESERVED THEN ANCIENT WATER DEPTHS CAN BE MEASURED. THE ZONATION OF LIVING REEFS HAS BEEN MEASURED USING SEMI-QUANTITATIVE PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL METHODS AS WELL AS A RANGE OF PLOT AND PLOTLESS TECHNIQUES, BUT THERE IS LITTLE AGREEMENT AS TO A SINGLE BEST METHOD. FOR THIS STUDY A MODIFIED LINE INTERCEPT TRANSECT METHOD IS SELECTED AS IT MAY BE USED ON BOTH LIVING REEFS AND ON VARIOUS TYPES OF OUTCROPS OF FOSSIL REEFS. THIS METHOD MINIMIZES PROBLEMS ARISING FROM OUTCROP CONDITIONS, IS FASTER THAN QUADRAT METHODS, CAN BE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENT FRAME-BUILDING TAXA, MATRIX, CEMENT AND POROSITY ALONG ANCIENT REEF SURFACES, AND IS ALSO FREQUENTLY USED IN STUDIES OF LIVING REEFS. THE ZONATION OF CORALS AND CORALLINE ALGAE ON LIVING AND FOSSIL REEFS CAN BE CHARACTERIZED BY THREE PARAMETERS: FRAMEWORK DENSITY, DIVERSITY AND SPECIES ABUNDANCE. THE FRAMEWORK DENSITY OF REEF CORALS IS NORMALLY GREATEST ON EXTERNAL REEF SLOPES BETWEEN 1 AND 30 M AND DECREASES INTO SHALLOW REEF CREST ENVIRONMENTS, AND TOWARDS SHORELINES. CORALLINE ALGAL FRAMEWORKS ARE HIGHEST IN REEF CREST ENVIRONMENTS AND MAY ALSO REPLACE CORAL FRAMEWORKS IN DEEPER REEF-SLOPE ENVIRONMENTS. VARIATIONS IN DIVERSITY ARE COMPLEX AND RELATE TO BIOGEOGRAPHICAL CONSTRAINTS AS WELL AS LOCAL VARIATIONS OF PHYSICAL FACTORS AND BIOLOGICAL FACTORS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF REEF-BUILDING ASSEMBLAGES IS OFTEN EXPRESSED AS A ZONATION WHICH MAY RELATE TO DEPTH BUT ALSO TO HYDRAULIC ENERGY. EXAMPLES OF CORAL AND CORALLINE ALGAL ZONATION ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED FROM INDO-PACIFIC AND CARIBBEAN REEFS. THREE CASE STUDIES ARE PRESENTED BASED ON THE AUTHORS' WORK ON REEF ZONATION. THE SEYCHELLES REEFS (INDIAN OCEAN) ARE USED TO ILLUSTRATE DEPTH AND WATER ENERGY RELATED ZONATION OF PRESENT-DAY LIVING CORALS. CORALLINE ALGAL ZONATION IS ILLUSTRATED FROM PRESENT-DAY ST CROIX REEFS (CARIBBEAN), TOGETHER WITH PRESERVED ZONES IN SECTIONS THROUGH THESE REEFS. CORAL AND CORALLINE ALGAL ZONATION ON FOSSIL REEFS ARE CHARACTERIZED USING OUR MODIFIED LINE INTERCEPT TRANSECT TECHNIQUE ON EXPOSURES FROM LATE MIOCENE REEFS OF MALLORCA (SPAIN). THIS REVIEW OF REEF ZONATION AND INTRODUCTION OF A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR SURVEYING ANCIENT REEF COMMUNITIES TO ESTABLISH DEPTH RELATED ZONES HAS IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OVER PREVIOUS QUALITATIVE APPROACHES. DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF PALAEODEPTHS IN THE FIELD MAKE SUBJECTIVE PALAEOBATHYMETRIC INTERPRETATIONS UNNECESSARY AND AVOIDS THE PROBLEMS OF ASSUMING UNIFORMITARIANISM. IN SITU ORGANISM ASSEMBLAGES ARE SAMPLED WHICH MINIMIZES THE EFFECTS OF TAPHONOMIC CHANGES ON COMMUNITY COMPOSITION.

MOST OF THEM (112) ARE PELAGIC, 86 ARE REEF-ASSOCIATED SPECIES AND 27 ARE DEEP-WATER SPECIALISTS. SPECIES ACCUMULATION CURVES SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF FISH SPECIES HAS NOT YET REACHED AN ASYMPTOTE. WHEREAS THE NUMBER OF SPECIES RECORDED IN SPSPA IS SIMILAR TO THAT IN OTHER OCEANIC ISLANDS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, THE PROPORTION OF SHOREFISHES IS RELATIVELY LOWER, AND THE ENDEMISM LEVEL IS THE THIRD HIGHEST IN THE ATLANTIC. TWENTY-NINE SPECIES ARE LISTED AS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION. OBSERVATIONS CONFIRM THE PAUCITY OF TOP PREDATORS ON SHALLOW ROCKY REEFS OF THE ISLAND, DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL PELAGIC SHARK SPECIES AROUND SPSPA. BECAUSE ALL OF THE ENDEMIC SPECIES ARE REEF ASSOCIATED, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE NEW MARINE-PROTECTED AREAS CREATED BY THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT DO NOT ENSURE THE PROTECTION AND RECOVERY OF SPSPA'S BIODIVERSITY BECAUSE THEY ALLOW EXPLOITATION OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SPECIES AROUND THE ARCHIPELAGO ITSELF. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS A BAN ON REEF FISH EXPLOITATION INSIDE AN AREA DELIMITED BY THE 1000 M ISOBATH AROUND THE ISLANDS (WHERE ALL KNOWN ENDEMICS ARE CONCENTRATED) AS THE MAIN CONSERVATION STRATEGY TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SPSPA MANAGEMENT PLAN BEING PREPARED BY THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT.",10.1111/jfb.14484,PINHEIRO HT_2020_J FISH BIOL,,,,,,,

VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT CARIBBEAN REEF FISH MOVEMENTS CREATING A CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP THAT CAN IMPEDE EFFECTIVE MPA DESIGN, PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION. USING MINIATURE IMPLANTED ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS AND A FIXED ACOUSTIC RECEIVER ARRAY, WE ADDRESS THREE KEY QUESTIONS: HOW FAR CAN REEF FISH MOVE? DOES CONNECTIVITY EXIST BETWEEN ADJACENT MPAS? DOES EXISTING MPA SIZE MATCH THE SPATIAL SCALE OF REEF FISH MOVEMENTS? WE SHOW THAT MANY REEF FISHES ARE CAPABLE OF TRAVELING FAR GREATER DISTANCES AND IN SHORTER DURATION THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY KNOWN. ACROSS THE PUERTO RICAN SHELF, MORE THAN HALF OF OUR 163 TAGGED FISH (18 SPECIES OF 10 FAMILIES) MOVED DISTANCES GREATER THAN 1 KM WITH THREE FISH MOVING MORE THAN 10 KM IN A SINGLE DAY AND A QUARTER SPENDING TIME OUTSIDE OF MPAS. WE PROVIDE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY ACROSS A NETWORK OF MPAS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED MOVEMENTS OF MORE THAN 40 KM CONNECTING A NEARSHORE MPA WITH A SHELF-EDGE SPAWNING AGGREGATION. MOST TAGGED FISH SHOWED HIGH FIDELITY TO MPAS, BUT ALSO SPENT TIME OUTSIDE MPAS, POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO SPILLOVER.

COLONY AGE WAS ESTIMATED BY COUNTING ANNUAL GROWTH RINGS ON THIN SECTIONS OF 69 COLONIES. A 2-WAY ANOVA SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGE ESTIMATED BY THREE INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COLONY GROWTH RATE (BASAL DIAMETER), SHOWING SOME DECREASE WITH COLONY AGE INCREASE, WAS 0.26 MM/YR.

ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED TO OUTCOMPETE REEF-BUILDING CORALS FOLLOWING ENVIRONMENTAL DISTURBANCES, THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE AND THUS THEIR FUNCTIONAL IMPORTANCE IN REEFS ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IN PARTICULAR, THE ACCLIMATIZATION TO DEPTH OF SOFT CORALS HARBORING DINOFLAGELLATE SYMBIONTS AND THE METABOLIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTNERS HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION. WE PERFORMED STABLE ISOTOPE TRACER EXPERIMENTS ON TWO SOFT CORAL SPECIES (LITOPHYTON SP.

CARBON ACQUISITION AND RESPIRATION MEASUREMENTS DISTINGUISH LITOPHYTON SP. AS MAINLY AUTOTROPHIC AND RHYTISMA FULVUM FULVUM AS RATHER HETEROTROPHIC SPECIES. IN BOTH SPECIES, CARBON ACQUISITION WAS CONSTANT AT THE TWO INVESTIGATED DEPTHS. THIS IS A MAJOR DIFFERENCE FROM SCLERACTINIAN CORALS, WHOSE CARBON ACQUISITION DECREASES WITH DEPTH. IN ADDITION, CARBON ACQUISITION AND PHOTOSYNTHATE TRANSLOCATION TO THE HOST DECREASED WITH AN INCREASE IN SYMBIONT DENSITY, SUGGESTING THAT NUTRIENT PROVISION TO OCTOCORAL SYMBIONTS CAN QUICKLY BECOME A LIMITING FACTOR OF THEIR PRODUCTIVITY.

THEREFORE, THE CAPACITY OF DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CORALS AND THEIR ALGAL SYMBIONTS (SYMBIODINIACEAE) TO EFFICIENTLY EXPLOIT THE AVAILABLE NITROGEN SOURCES WILL INFLUENCE THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE. RECENT STUDIES HAVE ADVANCED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NITROGEN ASSIMILATION IN REEF-BUILDING SCLERACTINIAN (HARD) CORAL-SYMBIODINIACEAE SYMBIOSES. HOWEVER, THE NUTRIENT METABOLISM OF OTHER CORAL TAXA, SUCH AS ALCYONIINA (SOFT CORALS), REMAINS UNDEREXPLORED. USING STABLE ISOTOPE LABELING, WE INVESTIGATED THE ASSIMILATION OF DISSOLVED NITROGEN (I.E., AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND FREE AMINO ACIDS) BY MULTIPLE SPECIES OF SOFT AND HARD CORALS SAMPLED IN THE GULF OF AQABA IN SHALLOW (8-10 M) AND MESOPHOTIC (40-50 M) REEFS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT DISSOLVED NITROGEN ASSIMILATION RATES PER TISSUE BIOMASS WERE UP TO 10-FOLD HIGHER IN HARD THAN IN SOFT CORAL SYMBIOSES FOR ALL SOURCES OF NITROGEN. ALTHOUGH SUCH DIFFERENCES IN ASSIMILATION RATES COULD BE LINKED TO THE SYMBIODINIACEAE DENSITY, SYMBIODINIACEAE SPECIES, OR THE C:N RATIO OF THE HOST AND ALGAL SYMBIONT FRACTIONS, NONE OF THESE PARAMETERS WERE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO CORAL TAXA. INSTEAD, THE LOWER ASSIMILATION RATES IN SOFT CORAL SYMBIOSES MIGHT BE EXPLAINED BY THEIR DIFFERENT NUTRITIONAL STRATEGY: WHEREAS SOFT CORALS MAY OBTAIN MOST OF THEIR NITROGEN VIA THE CAPTURE OF PLANKTONIC PREY BY THE CORAL HOST (HETEROTROPHIC FEEDING), HARD CORALS MAY RELY MORE ON DISSOLVED NITROGEN ASSIMILATION BY THEIR ALGAL SYMBIONTS TO FULFILL THEIR NEEDS. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS DIFFERENT NUTRITIONAL STRATEGIES IN SOFT AND HARD CORAL SYMBIOSES. A HIGHER RELIANCE ON HETEROTROPHY MAY HELP SOFT CORALS TO GROW IN REEFS WITH HIGHER TURBIDITY, WHICH HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF PARTICLES IN SUSPENSION IN SEAWATER.

HOWEVER, INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR NUTRITIONAL ECOLOGY ALONG THE DEPTH GRADIENT, AND IN PARTICULAR THE CHANGES IN THE AUTOTROPHIC AND HETEROTROPHIC ACQUISITION OF NUTRIENTS, IS LIMITED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT NUTRIENT ACQUISITION IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS IN EXPLAINING THE DISTRIBUTION OF REEF ORGANISMS. HERE, THE ABUNDANCE OF THREE LIPID BIOMARKERS, SPECIFIC FOR AUTOTROPHY AND HETEROTROPHY, WAS INVESTIGATED IN THE TISSUE OF FOUR OCTOCORAL SPECIES AND ONE SCLERACTINIAN SAMPLED IN SHALLOW AND UPPER MESOPHOTIC REEFS OF THE OLIGOTROPHIC NORTHERN RED SEA. OUR FINDINGS SHOW FUNCTIONAL MIXOTROPHY FOR ALL DINOFLAGELLATE-BEARING SPECIES, WITH A SIGNIFICANT INPUT OF HETEROTROPHIC FEEDING ON HERBIVOROUS CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON AT BOTH DEPTHS. THE RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF THE HETEROTROPHIC MARKER IN ALL SYMBIOTIC SPECIES IN SHALLOW CONDITIONS DOES NOT CORROBORATE THE COMMON IDEA THAT CORALS RELY MOSTLY ON AUTOTROPHY IN SHALLOW WATERS. THE INCREASE IN HETEROTROPHIC CAPACITY WITH DEPTH WAS HOWEVER SPECIES-SPECIFIC, LIKELY RELATED TO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, OCTOCORALS MAINTAINED SIMILAR CONCENTRATIONS OF AUTOTROPHIC MARKERS WITH INCREASING DEPTH, WHILE THE SCLERACTINIAN SPECIES EXHIBITED A DECREASE IN THESE MARKERS WITH DEPTH. THESE RESULTS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS OF PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY-FIXED CARBON ACQUISITION, SUGGESTING THAT AUTOTROPHY REMAINS STABLE IN RED SEA SOFT CORALS, WHEREAS IT DECREASES IN SCLERACTINIAN CORALS.

FISHING EFFORTS MAY ALSO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AMONG-LOCATION DIFFERENCES AS THE HIGHLY EXPLOITED LOCATION HAD THE LOWEST FISH BIOMASS. THE LOW VARIATION BETWEEN DEPTHS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SIMILAR BENTHIC COMPOSITION AT EACH LOCATION, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY BETWEEN DEPTHS DUE TO HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, FISH MOTILITY, AND THE COMMON FISHING GEARS USED IN THE PHILIPPINES THAT CAN LIKELY EXTEND BEYOND SWRS.

THE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGE AT THE 80M REEF WAS VERY DISTINCT FROM THAT AT 6M.

NEARSHORE SURFACE WATERS ARE TURBID OUT TO APPROXIMATELY THE 10 M ISOBATH. A TURBID NEPHELOID LAYER UP TO 20 M IN THICKNESS EXISTS BEYOND THIS DEPTH. SEASONAL TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY VARIABILITY IS HIGH IN NEARSHORE WATERS. AT THE SHELF EDGE, THE TEMPERATURE TO 50 M DEPTH REMAINS ABOVE 19C. TOPOGRAPHIC PROMINENCES ARE COMMON IN THE REGION. MOST ARE SURFACE EXPRESSIONS OF THE DIAPIRISM OF UNDERLYING SALT DOMES DERIVED FROM DEEPLY BURIED JURASSIC SALT DEPOSITS. BIOTIC ZONATION ON THE BANKS IS PRIMARILY DEPTH RELATED. ZONES OF MAJOR REEF-BUILDING INCLUDE THE DIPLORIA- MONTASTREA-PORITES ZONE (15-36 M), THE MADRACIS ZONE (28-46 M), THE STEPHANOCOENIA-MILLEPORA ZONE (36-52 M), AND THE ALGAL-SPONGE ZONE (45-98 M). A ZONE OF MINOR REEFBUILDING ON SOME BANKS IS THE MILLEPORA ZONE (18-52 M). AN ANTIPATHARIAN TRANSITIONAL ZONE EXISTS FROM 56 TO OVER 100 M ON SOME BANKS. THE NEPHELOID ZONE NEAR THE BASE OF THE BANKS IS A ZONE OF NO REEF-BUILDING. NOT ALL ZONES ARE PRESENT ON ALL BANKS. THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DEPTHS OF THESE ZONES DEPEND ON AND ARE MODIFIED BY THE REGIONAL CURRENT REGIME, DEPTH OF THE BANK CRESTS, SUBSTRATE CHARACTERISTICS, WINTER TEMPERATURE MINIMA, RIVER INFLUENCES, AND THE RELATIVE DEPTH AND THICKNESS OF THE NEPHELOID LAYER. NEARSHORE COMMUNITIES ARE WARM TEMPERATE IN NATURE, THOUGH TROPICAL ORGANISMS ARE OCCASIONALLY ABUNDANT. PROGRESSING OFFSHORE, THE BENTHOS BECOMES INCREASINGLY TROPICAL. THE NORTHERLY LOCATION AND ISOLATED NATURE OF THE FLOWER GARDENS HAVE LEAD TO REDUCED COMMUNITY DIVERSITY (E.G., ONLY 18 OF THE 55 WESTERN ATLANTIC HERMATYPIC CORAL SPECIES EXIST), BUT NOT REDUCED ABUNDANCES OR GROWTH RATES OF THE SPECIES PRESENT. ASSEMBLAGES ON OTHER BANKS EXIST BELOW THE TOLERANCE LIMITS OF THRIVING TROPICAL REEFS DUE TO THEIR FREQUENT IMMERSION IN TURBID WATER, EXCESSIVE CREST DEPTHS, OR LOWER MINIMUM WINTER TEMPERATURES.

ROBERTS HH,1992,CONT SHELF RES,BIOLOGIC AND GEOLOGIC RESPONSES TO PHYSICAL PROCESSES - EXAMPLES FROM MODERN REEF SYSTEMS OF THE CARIBBEAN-ATLANTIC REGION,NA,"CORAL REEFS AND ASSOCIATED DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS OF THE CARIBBEAN-ATLANTIC REGION HAVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT REFLECT CONTROL BY PHYSICAL PROCESSES, BOTH OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC. WAVE DIRECTION AND WAVE POWER HELP DETERMINE SITES FOR PRODUCTIVE REEF DEVELOPMENT AND SHAPE REEF MORPHOLOGY AS WELL AS COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. SPUR AND GROOVE ORIENTATIONS REFLECT CHANGES IN DIRECTION OF WAVES AS THEY REFRACT ACROSS A REEF-DOMINATED SHELF. ABRUPT TOPOGRAPHY OF REEF-DOMINATED SHELF MARGINS INTERACTS WITH TIDALLY MODULATED FLOWS TO CREATE AN ENERGETIC AND PRODUCTIVE DEEP REEF ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS BUFFERED FROM THE MODIFYING EFFECTS OF FORCEFUL WAVE ACTION. SHALLOW WAVE-REEF INTERACTIONS INVOLVE DISSIPATIVE EFFECTS OF WAVE BREAKING, TURBULENCE, AND FRICTION, RESULTING IN MEASURED WAVE ENERGY TRANSFORMATIONS RANGING FROM 72 TO 97\% DEPENDING ON REEF CONFIGURATION AND WATER DEPTH. DISSIPATIVE PROCESSES PRODUCE STRONG REEF-NORMAL SURGE CURRENTS THAT TRANSPORT SEDIMENT LAGOONWARD, DRIVE BACKREEF LAGOON CIRCULATION, AND INFLUENCE FLUID FLOW AND DIAGENESIS WITHIN THE REEF. THE INTENSITY OF THESE PROCESSES IS MODULATED AT THE TIDAL FREQUENCY. OTHER LONG PERIOD WAVES (INFRAGRAVITY) ARE IMPORTANT AGENTS OF MASS TRANSPORT OF WATER AND FINE SEDIMENT. LOW SPEED, LONG DURATION CURRENTS FORCED BY LONG WAVES ARE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPORTING LARVAE AS WELL AS FINE SEDIMENT OUT OF A GIVEN REEF-LAGOON SYSTEM. OCEAN-SCALE CURRENTS IMPINGING ON STEEP ISLAND AND CONTINENTAL MARGIN TOPOGRAPHY MAY CAUSE REEF-LIMITING UPWELLING AND NUTRIENT LOADING. THE CARIBBEAN CURRENT UPWELLS ON THE NICARAGUA SHELF AND CARBONATE PLATFORMS OF THE NICARAGUAN RISE. HIGH TROPHIC RESOURCES FAVOR ALGAL RATHER THAN CORAL COMMUNITIES AND LARGE (20-30 M RELIEF) HALIMEDA BIOTHERMS OCCUPY NICHES NORMALLY RESERVED FOR CORAL REEFS. THERMODYNAMIC AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS (HEAT, MOISTURE AND MOMENTUM FLUX) REGULATE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF REEF LAGOON AND BANK TOP WATERS. IN EXTRA-TROPICAL REEF SETTINGS (E.G. BERMUDA, FLORIDA, BAHAMAS AND ARABIAN GULF) COLD AIR OUTBREAKS CAUSE PRECIPITOUS DROPS IN BANK WATER TEMPERATURES AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BANK WATER SALINITY AND SUSPENDED SEDIMENT LOAD. WATER TEMPERATURES ARE ROUTINELY FORCED BELOW THE LIMIT FOR SURVIVAL OF REEF CORALS AND MANY SPECIES OF CALCAREOUS GREEN ALGAE. ASSOCIATED INCREASES IN THE DENSITY OF SHALLOW WATERS PRODUCE A DISEQUILIBRIUM WITH SURFACE WATERS OF THE ADJACENT OCEAN FAVORING SHELF TRANSPORT TO DEEP WATER SITES OF REEF DEVELOPMENT AND BEYOND.",10.1016/0278-4343(92)90046-M,ROBERTS HH_1992_CONT SHELF RES,,,,,,,

OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DEEP-REEF FISHES IS BASED ON SHIP-BOARD SAMPLING AND THE RECENT USE OF REBREATHER DIVING, REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES (ROVS), BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEOS, AND CREWED SUBMERSIBLES. SUBMERSIBLE RESEARCH ON GC DEEP-REEF FISHES BEGAN IN THE 1960S AND HAS FLOURISHED OVER THE LAST DECADE THROUGH RESEARCH BY THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION'S DEEP REEF OBSERVATION PROJECT (DROP). HERE WE QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTION OF SUBMERSIBLE RESEARCH, PARTICULARLY THE SURGE BY DROP, TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE DEEP-REEF FISH FAUNA OF THE GC. WE COMPARED SHALLOW- AND DEEP-REEF FISH FAUNAS OF THREE GC SITES SUBJECTED TO DROP RESEARCH TO FAUNAS OF THREE SITES WITHOUT SUCH RESEARCH. DROP INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE DEEP FAUNAS AT THREE ISLANDS SIMILAR TO 9-FOLD, AND THEY HAVE DEEP-REEF FAUNAS SIMILAR TO 2-4 TIMES THE SIZE OF THOSE OF THE OTHER THREE SITES. THOSE DEEP-REEF FAUNAS HAVE HIGH PROPORTIONS OF SMALL CRYPTOBENTHIC FISHES, WHICH ALSO REPRESENT A MAJOR COMPONENT OF SHALLOW FAUNAS. THAT RESEARCH INCREASED THE RATE OF DISCOVERY (COLLECTION) OF NEW SPECIES OF DEEP-REEF FISHES SIMILAR TO 6-FOLD AND ACCOUNTS FOR 31\% OF THE DEEP-REEF SPECIES FIRST DISCOVERED WITHIN THE GC. SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF NEW SPECIES AT EACH OF THE THREE DROP ISLANDS WERE NOT FOUND AT THE OTHER TWO. THIS INDICATES THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE GC LIKELY HARBOR MANY UNDETECTED DEEP-REEF FISHES, AND THAT THE SIZE OF THE DEEP-REEF FAUNA OF THE GC IS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERESTIMATED. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SMALL RESEARCH SUBMERSIBLES ARE VERSATILE, HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE TOOLS FOR DEEP-REEF STUDIES. THEY ALLOW LONG-DURATION DIVES AT ANY DEPTH, WHILE OFFERING UNPARALLELED VIEWS OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS TO STUDY THE ECOLOGY OF DEEP-REEF FISHES (E.G., DROP'S DEFINITION OF THE RARIPHOTIC ASSEMBLAGE FROM FISH DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS).

AN INCREASE IN COVER AND DECREASE IN DIVERSITY WITH DEPTH WOULD ALSO BE EXPECTED BECAUSE DEEPER REEF ZONES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE LESS DISTURBANCE.

CARUNCULATA ACROSS A EUPHOTIC-MESOPHOTIC GRADIENT (0-90 M) IN THE SAINT PETER AND SAINT PAUL'S ARCHIPELAGO (SPSPA, MID ATLANTIC RIDGE, BRAZIL). SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED USING SCUBA AND A REMOTE OPERATED VEHICLE (ROV). A TOTAL OF 189 INDIVIDUALS WERE OBSERVED AND A SHARP INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE WITH DEPTH WAS RECORDED, PARTICULARLY FROM 50 M DEPTH ONWARDS. IN THE MESOPHOTIC ZONE (50-90 M) INDIVIDUALS WERE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH BRANCHING BLACK-CORALS (TANACETIPATHES SPP.) AND PREDATION OVER BLACK-CORALS AND THE SCLERACTINIAN MADRACIS DECACTIS WAS COMMONLY SIGHTED. A BOOSTED REGRESSION TREE MODEL INDICATED BLACK-CORAL ABUNDANCE AS THE MAIN DRIVER OF H. CARUNCULATA ABUNDANCE, SUGGESTING THAT PREFERENCE FOR OPTIMAL HABITATS TO HIDE/FORAGE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN DEPTH PER SE ON THE BATHYMETRIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIREWORM. THE HIGH ABUNDANCES OF H.

REEF-LIKE HABITATS ARE RELATIVELY UNCOMMON ON THE MAB SHELF; THEREFORE, SHIPWRECKS MAY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT HABITAT RESOURCE. DURING FALL 2012 AND SPRING 2013, 9 SITES (DEPTHS: 42-126 M) NEAR NORFOLK CANYON WERE SURVEYED BY USING REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES. ONE SITE CONSISTED OF SAND BOTTOM, ONE CONSISTED OF PREDOMINANTLY NATURAL HARD BOTTOM, AND 7 SITES INCLUDED 8 LARGE SHIPWRECKS. OF 38 FISH TAXA IDENTIFIED, 33 OCCURRED ON HARD BOTTOM AND 25 OCCURRED ON SOFT SUBSTRATA. FOURTEEN FISH TAXA OCCURRED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON HARD BOTTOM, AND 6 SPECIES WERE OBSERVED ONLY ON SOFT BOTTOM. THE MOST ABUNDANT TAXA, ESPECIALLY ON REEF HABITAT, WERE THE CHAIN DOGFISH (SCYLIORHINUS RETIFER), A SCORPIONFISH (SCORPAENA SP.), THE YELLOWFIN BASS (ANTHIAS NICHOLSI), THE RED BARBIER (BALDWINELLA VIVANUS), THE BLACK SEA BASS (CENTROPRISTIS STRIATA), UNIDENTIFIED ANTHIINE SERRANIDS, AND THE DEEP BODY BOARFISH (ANTIGONIA CAPROS). DEPTH, LOCATION, AND SEASON DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE FISH ASSEMBLAGES. FISH ASSEMBLAGES ON NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL HARD-BOTTOM HABITAT WERE SIMILAR BUT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM SOFT-BOTTOM ASSEMBLAGES.

AMONG THE ECOSYSTEM-ENGINEERING SPECIES THAT STRUCTURE THE SEASCAPE, MARINE ANIMAL FORESTS (MAFS) ARE THE MOST WIDESPREAD. THESE HABITATS, MAINLY COMPOSED OF SUSPENSION FEEDING ORGANISMS, PROVIDE STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY TO THE SEA FLOOR, ANALOGOUS TO TERRESTRIAL FORESTS. BECAUSE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PRODUCTIVITY IS RESPONDING TO DIFFERENT IMPACTS, IN PARTICULAR TO THE RAPID ONGOING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE, THIS PAPER PRESENTS SOME DIRECTIONS ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO DIFFERENT MAFS DEPENDING ON THESE FAST CHANGES. CLIMATE CHANGE COULD MODIFY THE RESISTANCE OR RESILIENCE OF MAFS, POTENTIALLY MAKING THEM MORE SENSITIVE TO IMPACTS FROM ANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES (I.E. FISHERIES AND COASTAL MANAGEMENT), AND VICE VERSA, DIRECT IMPACTS MAY AMPLIFY CLIMATE CHANGE CONSTRAINTS IN MAFS. SUCH CHANGES WILL HAVE KNOCK-ON EFFECTS ON THE ENERGY BUDGETS OF ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SUSPENSION FEEDING ORGANISMS, AS WELL AS ON THEIR PHENOLOGY, LARVAL NUTRITIONAL CONDITION, AND POPULATION VIABILITY. HOW THE FUTURE SEASCAPE WILL BE SHAPED BY THE NEW ENERGY FLUXES IS A CRUCIAL QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE URGENTLY ADDRESSED TO MITIGATE AND ADAPT TO THE DIVERSE IMPACTS ON NATURAL SYSTEMS.",10.1093/icesjms/fsz147,ROSSI S_2019_ICES J MAR SCI,,,,,,,

BECAUSE FLUORESCENT PROTEINS (FPS) ABSORB HIGH-ENERGY LIGHT AND EMIT LOWER-ENERGY LIGHT, FPS COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MESOPHOTIC CORAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY. FOR 4 SPECIES OF THE HAWAIIAN MESOPHOTIC REEF-BUILDING CORAL LEPTOSERIS (65-125 M), WE INVESTIGATED THE ABUNDANCE OF FLUORESCENT MORPHS, TYPES OF FPS, FLUORESCENCE EMISSION PHENOTYPES, AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORAL FLUORESCENCE AND ENDOSYMBIOTIC SYMBIODINIUM (DINOFLAGELLATE; DINOPHYTA).

HOWEVER, WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES OCCUR ABRUPTLY, ORGANISMS' ADAPTIVE CAPABILITIES CAN BE LIMITED, LEADING TO THE DEATH OF SOME COLONIES OR TO MASS MORTALITIES. ADDITIONALLY, A DECREASE IN BODY SIZE HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON RESPONSES IN BOTH TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ORGANISMS TO FACE GLOBAL WARMING. HERE, TEMPERATE CORALS' RESPONSE TO THERMAL STRESS WAS DOCUMENTED USING THE PRECIOUS RED CORAL CORALLIUM RUBRUM AS A MODEL SPECIES. THE INCREASED FREQUENCY OF MARINE HEAT WAVES RECORDED IN THE NORTH-WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN HAS LED TO A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COLONIES OF THE ANALYSED POPULATIONS AND REDUCED COLONY SIZE IN THOSE THAT HAVE SURVIVED, LIKELY THROUGH FRAGMENTATION AND BRANCH LOSS. THE LABORATORY ANALYSES CARRIED OUT ON COLLECTED FRAGMENTS SHOWED AN UNEXPECTED SWELLING, SIMILAR TO RESORPTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE OCCURRENCE OF REGULAR SCLERITE-LIKE PROTUBERANCES, TYPICAL OF A NORMAL SKELETON SURFACE, SUGGESTED A REGENERATION PROCESS. THE DOCUMENTED PHENOMENON SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT C.

WE ESTIMATED THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF DEEPWATER REEF FISH WITH A DOUBLE SAMPLING APPROACH USING FISHERIES ACOUSTICS AND CONVENTIONAL FISHING GEAR (HOOK AND LINE AND CHEVRON TRAPS). DOUBLE SAMPLING OCCURRED WITHIN THE NEWLY-CREATED SNOWY WRECK MARINE PROTECTED AREA AND A NEARBY CONTROL SITE. REEF FISH CONCENTRATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED BY A SINGLE-BEAM SIMRAD ES60 TRANSCEIVER WITH A TRANSDUCER OPERATING AT 38 KHZ.

SADD JL,1984,BULL MAR SCI,"SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND CACO3 BUDGET ON A FRINGING-REEF, CANE BAY, ST-CROIX, UNITED-STATES VIRGIN-ISLANDS",NA,"Continuous (1 year) study of the rates and mechanisms of sediment transport on the fringing reef indicates major volumetric transport in a seaward direction during storms by wave-generated oscillatory currents. The narrow (300 m) shelf in this semi-protected bay is nearly flat in its landward portion (forereef terrace) and slopes increasingly seaward (forereef slope) before terminating in a steep reef wall at −32 m. A marine hardground separates the active reef from the shoreface and acts as a barrier to transport under all but storm conditions.

Sediment accumulates on the shelf throughout most of the year, and is moved seaward during winter storms across the sandy forereef terrace and through sand-filled channels at the shelf edge. During calm sea conditions transport rates average about 4 × 10−5 m3/m day−1 while during storm seas, transport rates vary from about 4 × 10−4 (forereef terrace) to 4 × 10−3 m3/m day−1 (forereef slope). Absence of transport rates intermediate between storm and calm sea values is due to subtidal algal mat which binds the upper 0.5 cm of sediment and inhibits movement. The critical energy threshold required to destroy the mat is only attained by currents generated during times of long-period swell or storms. Biologically-induced transport is active year round on the forereef slope but is volumetrically subordinate to physical processes. Transport by gravity is relatively unimportant shallower than −32 m and contributes mainly by accentuating the effects of physical and biological transport.

Mass balance calculations of CaCO3 production and transport indicate that the observed sediment transport processes cannot remove all sediment produced annually by reef organisms. The reef depends on occasional extreme events, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, to balance sediment transport with production so as not to drown in its own accumulated sediments.",NA,SADD JL_1984_BULL MAR SCI,,,,,,,

TO ASSESS AND PREDICT THERMAL STRESS IMPACTS ON REEFS, REMOTELY OBSERVED SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) COMMONLY IS USED; HOWEVER, REEF COMMUNITIES TYPICALLY EXTEND TO DEPTHS WHERE SST ALONE MAY NOT BE AN ACCURATE MEASURE OF IN SITU VARIABILITY. HERE NEARLY TWO DECADES OF TEMPERATURE OBSERVATIONS (2- TO 90-M DEPTH) AT THREE STATIONS AROUND PALAU ARE USED TO DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY VERSUS DEPTH BASED ON SST AND SEA LEVEL ANOMALY (SLA). THE TECHNIQUE YIELDS DEPTH-AVERAGED R-2 VALUES >0.88, WITH SLA PREDICTING FORE REEF TEMPERATURES NEAR THE THERMOCLINE AND SST CAPTURING UPPER MIXED LAYER TEMPERATURES. SLA COMPLEMENTS SST BY PROVIDING A PROXY FOR VERTICAL ISOTHERM DISPLACEMENTS DRIVEN BY LOCAL AND REMOTE WINDS ON INTRASEASONAL TO INTERANNUAL TIME SCALES. UTILIZING THIS CONCEPT, THERMAL STRESS ON CORALS CAN BE PREDICTED FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH THE MESOPHOTIC ZONE. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY CORAL REEFS ARE OFTEN BLEACHED, LEADING TO THEIR DEATH, DUE TO EXCEEDINGLY WARM OCEAN TEMPERATURES. THE TEMPERATURE OF THE OCEAN'S SURFACE, MEASURED GLOBALLY BY SATELLITES, IS OFTEN USED AS AN INDICATOR OF THE TEMPERATURE AND STRESS THAT CORALS EXPERIENCE, BUT IT CAN ONLY TELL US WHAT IS HAPPENING NEAR THE SURFACE. WE PRESENT NEARLY TWO DECADES OF TEMPERATURE RECORDS FROM THE REEFS OF PALAU, AN ISLAND NATION IN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC. THIS ARRAY OF INSTRUMENTS WAS MAINTAINED BY SKILLED DIVERS ROUTINELY GOING DEEPER THAN 90 M. THE OBSERVATIONS ALLOW US TO SHOW THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE OCEAN SURFACE IS A STRONG INDICATOR OF HOW OCEAN TEMPERATURES ARE CHANGING TENS OF METERS BELOW. THIS CAN BE COUPLED WITH OBSERVED SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE TO PREDICT THE TEMPERATURES EXPERIENCED BY CORAL REEFS LIVING NEAR THE SURFACE AS WELL AS THOSE LIVING DEEPER, DOWN THROUGH THE MESOPHOTIC ZONE, AN AREA BETWEEN 30 AND 150 M DEEP. THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE TO HOW TEMPERATURE STRESS ON CORALS IS ASSESSED. WE ALSO FIND THAT THERMAL STRESS EVENTS CAN PENETRATE INTO THE REALM OF DEEP MESOPHOTIC CORAL REEFS, MEANING THAT THIS ZONE MIGHT NOT BE REFUGIA FOR CORALS LIVING IN A WARMING OCEAN.",10.1029/2018GL078782,SCHRAMEK TA_2018_GEOPHYS RES LETT,,,,,,,

THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EMPHASIS ARE THE CORAL ANIMAL AND THE REEF COMMUNITY. THE MAIN STUDY AREA IS THE RED SEA WHICH REACHES OVER 20 DEGREES LATITUDE UP TO THE NORTHERNMOST MARGIN OF THE GLOBAL CORAL REEF BELT. SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS ON MICROBORER ECOLOGY ARE PROVIDED FROM THE BAHAMAS. THE DESERT ENCLOSED RED SEA, NOT INFLUENCED BY LAND RUNOFF AND ONLY MINIMALLY BY ANTHROPOGENIC (URBAN AND TOURISTIC) NUTRIENT INPUTS, IS PREDESTINED FOR A STUDY ON THE PRINCIPAL INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON CALCIFICATION WITHIN BATHYMETRICAL AND LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS. HENCE, ON THE LEVEL OF THE ZOOXANTHELLATE SCLERACTINIAN ANIMAL PHOTOTROPHIC AND HETEROTROPHIC ENERGY SUPPLY AND ITS BEARING ON CALCIFICATION ARE BEING MEASURED IN DIFFERENT CORAL SPECIES - IN PARTICULAR IN PORITES SP., ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REEF BUILDERS. THE GROWTH OF 15 ZOOXANTHELLATE SCLERACTINIANS IN THE GULF OF AQABA CORRELATES WITH THE ANNUAL LIGHT CYCLE. THIS CORRELATION IS OBSERVABLE DOWN TO 40 M DEPTH. OTHER GROWTH PROMOTING FACTORS SEEM TO HAVE LESS INFLUENCE ON CORAL EXTENSION. THE AVAILABILITY OF ORGANICALLY ENRICHED SEDIMENTS IN SHALLOW WATER PROBABLY YIELDS NUTRITIONAL VALUE, IN PARTICULAR FOR FILTER FEEDING SPECIES, THUS RESTRICTING THEIR DISTRIBUTION TO THOSE AREAS. ZOOXANTHELLAE, WHEN ISOLATED FROM MYCEDIUM ELEPHANTOTUS, ARE DIFFERENT IN THEIR DEPENDENCE ON DEPTH IN MAXIMUM RATES OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY ( -SLOPE). INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF PIGMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF DEPTH COULD BE DETERMINED. MAXIMUM RATES OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF ZOOXANTHELLAE IN VIVO, COLLECTED AT CORRESPONDING DEPTH, HAVE BEEN 4 TIMES HIGHER. STRUCTURAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS IMPROVING HETEROTROPHIC AND PHOTOTROPHIC ENERGY INTAKE ARE HIGHLIGHTED. PORITES SP. WAS THE SUBJECT OF ANNUAL GROWTH STUDIES AT LOCATIONS EXTENDING FROM AQABA IN THE NORTH OVER THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN EGYPTIAN COAST AND ISLANDS, SANGANEB ATOLL AND WINGATE REEF OFFSHORE SUDAN TO THE GULF OF TADJOURA IN THE GULF OF ADEN (DJIBOUTI). MEAN GROWTH RATES IN THE SHALLOW WATER ZONE INCREASE WITH DECREASING LATITUDE AND ARE HIGHEST AT THE SOUTHERNMOST STUDIED REEFS IN THE GULF OF TADJOURA. HOWEVER, THE OBSERVED LATITUDINAL GROWTH REDUCTION IS RESTRICTED TO THE UPPER CA. 15 M OF THE WATER COLUMN. THE UPPER LIMIT OF GROWTH POTENTIAL DECREASES WITH DEPTH PARALLEL TO THE DECREASE OF LIGHT AVAILABILITY. HIGHEST GROWTH RATES ARE RECORDED IN SHALLOW DEPTH (10-12.9 MM YR(-1)). THIS ZONE REACHES AT AQABA (29 DEGREES 30'N) TO A DEPTH OF CA. 10 M. AT THE SOUTHERN EGYPTIAN REEFS (24 DEGREES 30'N) THIS ZONE EXTENDS TO CA. 15 M WATER DEPTH. THIS EFFECT IS PROBABLY A RESULT OF THE STRONGER REDUCTION OF WINTER LIGHT LEVELS AND WATER TEMPERATURE IN THE NORTHERN REGIONS. COMPARED TO OTHER OCEANS THE DECREASE OF GROWTH WITH INCREASING LATITUDE OF RED SEA PORITES CORALS IS FAR LESS, AND GROWTH RATES AT AQABA ARE THE HIGHEST OBSERVED AT THESE LATITUDES. ON THE LEVEL OF THE COMMUNITY OF REEF INHABITANTS FOUR PRINCIPAL TOPICS ARE ADDRESSED: THE FIRST ONE IS THE DYNAMICS OF THE PROPORTIONS OF HERMATYPIC AND AHERMATYPIC ORGANISMS AND OPEN SPACE. THE OCCURRENCE OF STONY AND SOFT CORALS AND THE SHARING OF EMPTY SPACE IN DIFFERENT REEF SECTIONS AT AQABA AND ON SANGANEB ATOLL WERE QUANTIFIED. SOFT CORALS, MAINLY SINULARIA- AND XENIID SPECIES, OCCUPY DECREASING SHARES WITH DEPTH. AMONG THE XENIA SPECIES A BATHYMETRICAL ZONATION PATTERN WAS DETECTED. THE NEXT ISSUE IS THE GROWTH IMPEDING ROLE OF SOFT CORALS AND GASTROPOD PARASITES AND PREDATORS ON SCLERACTINIANS. EXPERIMENTAL AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS SHOWED XENIID SOFT CORALS TO BE OPPORTUNISTIC I.E. OCCUPYING RAPIDLY OPEN SPACE RATHER THAN TO ATTACKING AND OUTCOMPETING STONY CORALS. AN INCREASINGLY SPECIALIZED BEHAVIOUR WAS DETECTED AMONG CORALLIVOROUS GASTROPODS OF THE FAMILY CORALLOPHILIDAE TO EXPLOIT THEIR CORAL HOSTS. WHEREAS THESE SNAILS ARE MORE OR LESS SESSILE AND DEPEND FOR A LONG TIME ON THE SURROUNDING HOST POLYPS THE MOBILE DRUPELLA CORNUS (THAIDIDAE) FORMS FEEDING AGGREGATIONS WHICH DENUDE MAINLY BRANCHING CORALS ON SHALLOW REEF PARTS. FURTHERMORE, THE ROLE COUNTERACTING REEF GROWTH OF MACRO- AND MICROBIOERODERS IS INVESTIGATED. DIADEMA SETOSUM IS A MAJOR DESTRUCTIVE AGENT ON REEFS AT AQABA (NOT IN THE CENTRAL RED SEA). THE GRAZING SEA URCHINS DO NOT ONLY KEEP POTENTIAL COLONIZATION AREA FREE BUT ALSO ERODE CARBONATE MATERIAL (E. G. 1468 G/M(2)/YEAR, 10 M DEPTH). DEMOGRAPHIC AND BATHYMETRIC PATTERNS IN THE SEA URCHIN POPULATION ARE ANALYZED INCLUDING THEIR BEARING ON BIOEROSION OF THE REEF. INVESTIGATIONS ON MICROBORING ORGANISMS IN CARBONATE MATERIAL HAVE STARTED IN THE RED SEA; INITIAL RESULTS, HOWEVER, ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FROM SIMILAR STUDIES NEAR LEE STOCKING ISLAND, BAHAMAS. THREE MAJOR ENVIRONMENTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DIFFERENT MICROBORERS. THESE ARE 1) THE INTERTIDAL ENVIRONMENT DOMINATED BY BORING CYANOBACTERIA, 2) REEF SITES FROM 2 TO 30 M WATER DEPTH DOMINATED BY A DIVERSE ASSEMBLAGE OF BORING CYANOBACTERIA AND CHLOROPHYTES, AND 3) THE DEEP REEF SLOPE FROM 100 TO 300 M DOMINATED BY BORING GREEN ALGAE AND HETEROTROPHS. THE BORING CHLOROPHYTE GENUS PHAEOPHILA APPEARS RAPIDLY AND DOMINATES AT SITES FROM 2 TO 30 M, BUT IT LEAVES VACATED BORINGS AND IS REPLACED BY OSTREOBIUM QUEKETTII AFTER 1 YEAR. DIFFERENT SUBSTRATE TYPES SHOW VERY DIFFERENT RATES OF COLONIZATION BY MICROBORERS. THE GREATEST EXCAVATION RATES (100 G /M(2)/3 MONTHS) OCCUR IN FINE-GRAINED LIMESTONE, WHILE THE SLOWEST RATES (0.5 G/M(2)/3 MONTHS) OCCUR IN CALCITE CRYSTALS. MOLLUSCAN SHELL MATERIAL SHOWS INTERMEDIATE RATES OF EXCAVATION. LIGHT CONDITIONS APPEAR VERY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THE GROWTH RATE AND DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT MICROBORERS BETWEEN THE SITES, HOWEVER, THE INTERACTION OF LIGHT WITH OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS SUBSTRATE, TIME PERIOD OF EXPOSURE, AND WATER QUALITY CONDITIONS MAY BE INVOLVED.",10.1007/BF02536867,SCHUHMACHER H_1995_FACIES,,,,,,,
SCHWARTZKOPF BD,2017,MAR COAST FISH,HABITAT SELECTION IMPORTANT FOR RED SNAPPER FEEDING ECOLOGY IN THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO,NA,"THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARED RED SNAPPER LUTJANUS CAMPECHANUS FEEDING ECOLOGY AMONG SEASONS, SIZES, AND NATURAL REEFS, AND BETWEEN NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL REEFS LOCATED ON THE LOUISIANA SHELF EDGE. AS LOW-QUALITY DIETS MAY HINDER GROWTH, REDUCE CONDITION, AND LEAD TO POOR REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT, INFORMATION ON DIETS FOR VARIOUS HABITAT TYPES OCCUPIED BY RED SNAPPER IS CRITICAL. THIS STUDY UTILIZED BOTH STOMACH CONTENT ANALYSIS AND NITROGEN (DELTA N-15) AND CARBON (DELTA C-13) STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE TISSUE. FISHES DOMINATED RED SNAPPER DIETS AT ALL SITES, IN ALL SEASONS, AND GENERALLY FOR ALL SIZE-CLASSES. A HIGH BIOMASS OF ZOOPLANKTON WAS CONSUMED AT THE ARTIFICIAL REEF AREA AND DURING SPRING. THE LARGEST NATURAL REEF PROVIDED THE WIDEST DIVERSITY OF PREY ITEMS, AND THERE WAS LITTLE OVERLAP IN PREY SPECIES CONSUMED BETWEEN NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL REEF HABITATS. HIGHER DELTA N-15 AND LOWER DELTA C-13 VALUES WERE FOUND FOR RED SNAPPER AT THE ARTIFICIAL REEF AREA, AND CONTRARY TO THE DIET RESULTS, DISTINCT ISOTOPIC NICHES WERE FOUND BETWEEN NATURAL REEFS. DIFFERENCES IN RED SNAPPER ISOTOPIC NICHES BETWEEN NATURAL REEFS INDICATE THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY REMAIN IN RESIDENCE ON A SPECIFIC REEF FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD. RED SNAPPER AT NATURAL REEFS WERE FOUND TO FEED ON AND ABOVE THE REEF, WHEREAS FEEDING AT ARTIFICIAL REEFS PREDOMINANTLY OCCURRED ON THE SURROUNDING SEAFLOOR AND UP IN THE WATER COLUMN. THE QUALITY OF HABITATS UNDERLYING REEFS IS IMPORTANT, AS RED SNAPPER DIETS REFLECTED THE SUBSTRATE AT THE OCCUPIED REEFS. IN THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO, LARGE, COMPLEX NATURAL REEFS MAY PROVIDE HIGHER HABITAT QUALITY FOR RED SNAPPER WITH RESPECT TO PREY RESOURCES THAN ARTIFICIAL REEFS LOCATED ON MUD SUBSTRATES. DETERMINING WHICH HABITATS PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY PREY RESOURCES FOR RED SNAPPER IN THE GULF OF MEXICO MAY ASSIST DECISIONS ON POLICIES AND REGULATIONS FOR HABITAT PROTECTION AS WELL AS DECISIONS ON THE FUTURE PLACEMENT OF ARTIFICIAL REEFS.",10.1080/19425120.2017.1347117,SCHWARTZKOPF BD_2017_MAR COAST FISH,,,,,,,

THE RESILIENCE ACROSS THESE COMMUNITIES WAS HETEROGENEOUS, WITH SOME REQUIRING YEARS IF NOT DECADES TO FULLY RECOVER. TO SYNTHESIZE ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS AND RECOVERY FOLLOWING DWH, THE GULF OF MEXICO RESEARCH INITIATIVE (GOMRI) CORE 3 SYNTHESIS GROUP SUBDIVIDED THE NGOM INTO FOUR ECOTYPES: COASTAL, CONTINENTAL SHELF, OPEN-OCEAN, AND DEEP BENTHIC. HERE WE PRESENT A SYNOPSIS OF THE DEEP BENTHIC ECOTYPE STATUS AND DISCUSS PROGRESS MADE ON FIVE TASKS: (1) SUMMARIZING PRE- AND POST-OIL SPILL TRENDS IN ABUNDANCE, SPECIES COMPOSITION, AND DYNAMICS; (2) IDENTIFYING MISSING DATA/ANALYSES AND PROPOSING A STRATEGY TO FILL IN THESE GAPS; (3) CONSTRUCTING A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF IMPORTANT SPECIES INTERACTIONS AND IMPACTING FACTORS; (4) EVALUATING RESILIENCY AND RECOVERY POTENTIAL OF DIFFERENT SPECIES; AND (5) PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE LONG-TERM BENTHIC ECOSYSTEM RESEARCH PROGRAMS. TO ADDRESS THESE TASKS, WE ASSESSED TIME SERIES TO DETECT MEASURES OF POPULATION TRENDS. MOREOVER, A BENTHIC CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR THE GOM DEEP BENTHOS WAS DEVELOPED AND A VULNERABILITY-RESILIENCE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO ENABLE HOLISTIC INTERPRETATION OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG ECOTYPES, RESOURCES, AND STRESSORS. THE DWH OIL SPILL UNDERSCORES THE OVERALL NEED FOR A SYSTEM-LEVEL BENTHIC MANAGEMENT DECISION SUPPORT TOOL BASED ON LONG-TERM MEASUREMENT OF ECOLOGICAL QUALITY STATUS (EQS). PRODUCTION OF SUCH A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL REQUIRES TEMPORAL BASELINES AND TIME-SERIES DATA COLLECTIONS. THIS APPROACH PROVIDES EQS FOR MULTIPLE STRESSORS AFFECTING THE GOM BEYOND OIL SPILLS. IN MANY CASES, THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM DWH, THE GAPS IDENTIFIED, AND THE RECOMMENDED APPROACHES FOR FUTURE LONG-TERM HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN RESEARCH CAN BE UTILIZED TO BETTER ASSESS IMPACTS OF ANY ECOSYSTEM PERTURBATION OF INDUSTRIAL IMPACT, INCLUDING MARINE MINERAL EXTRACTION.",10.3389/fmars.2020.560012,SCHWING PT_2020_FRONT MAR SCI,,,,,,,
SCOFFIN TP,1985,CORAL REEFS,SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS OF THE CENTRAL REGION OF THE GREAT BARRIER-REEF OF AUSTRALIA,NA,"The sediments and calcareous organisms on the outer reefal shelf of the Central Region of the Great Barrier Reef were collected and observed by SCUBA diving and research vessel techniques (including underwater television) to understand the production and processes of deposition of the sediment. The carbonate grains are mainly sand and gravel size and solely of skeletal origin. Over the whole area the major CaCO3 producers, in order of decreasing importance are: benthic foraminiferans (chiefly Operculina, Amphistegina, Marginopora, Alveolinella and Cycloclypeus), the calcareous green alga Halimeda, molluscs and corals. Coral abundance is high only close to reefs and submerged rocky substrates. Benthic foraminiferal sands dominate the inter-reef areas i.e. the bulk of the shelf, and Halimeda gravels form an outer shelf band between 60 and 100 m depths. Seven distinct facies are recognised after quantitative analyses of the sediments. These are: A. Shelf edge slope (>120 m depth); B. Shelf edge (with rocky outcrops); C. Outer shelf with high Halimeda (>40%); D. Inter-reef I; E. Inter-reef II ( 100 m depth but >2% pelagics); F. Lee-ward reef talus wedge (<2 km from sea level reefs); G.

IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT SPONGE ABUNDANCE INCREASES WITH DEPTH THROUGH 150 M ON REEFS THROUGHOUT THE CARIBBEAN AND PERHAPS GLOBALLY (THE ``SPONGE INCREASE HYPOTHESIS''). A RECENT REVIEW CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE TO SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS FOR THE CARIBBEAN AND THAT FURTHER DATA QUANTIFYING CHANGES IN SPONGE ABUNDANCE WITH DEPTH ON MESOPHOTIC REEFS ARE NEEDED. IN THIS STUDY, PERCENTAGE COVER OF SPONGES, MACROALGAE, AND HARD CORALS WAS ESTIMATED USING 1123 IMAGES TAKEN BY REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES ON 58 DIVE TRACKS ON MESOPHOTIC REEFS OFF THE COASTS OF PUERTO RICO (TO 180 M) AND ST. THOMAS (US VIRGIN ISLANDS; TO 100 M), AND ON THE FLOWER GARDEN BANKS (GULF OF MEXICO; TO 100 M). OFF PUERTO RICO, SPONGE COVER DECREASED WITH INCREASING DEPTH BELOW * 100 M, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A DECLINE IN THE COVER OF EMERGENT (NON-ENCRUSTING) SPONGE SPECIES. SPONGE COVER DID NOT CHANGE WITH DEPTH OFF ST. THOMAS OR ON THE FLOWER GARDEN BANKS AND WAS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER ON THE FLOWER GARDEN BANKS. THE DATA FROM THESE THREE LOCATIONS DID NOT SUPPORT THE SPONGE INCREASE HYPOTHESIS. MEAN COVER OF HARD CORAL OFF PUERTO RICO AND ST. THOMAS WAS LESS THAN 8\% BETWEEN 20 AND 80 M AND NEGLIGIBLE BELOW THESE DEPTHS, BUT MUCH HIGHER (* 15-30\%) BETWEEN 30 AND 40 M ON THE FLOWER GARDEN BANKS AND NEGLIGIBLE BELOW THESE DEPTHS. OFF PUERTO RICO, COVER OF MACROALGAE DECREASED WITH DEPTH IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO SPONGE COVER, WHICH MAY REFLECT A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPONGES AND MACROALGAE IN THE LOWER MESOPHOTIC ZONE ([ 100 M). OFF ST. THOMAS AND ON THE FLOWER GARDEN BANKS, WHICH WERE BOTH SHALLOWER SITES WITH MORE ABUNDANT MACROALGAE, SPONGE ABUNDANCE WAS LIKELY LIMITED DUE TO COMPETITION FOR SPACE.

THIS STUDY USED BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO (BRUV) SYSTEMS TO DOCUMENT VARIATION IN THE TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL (TROPHIC AND SIZE) STRUCTURE OF A FISH ASSEMBLAGE ALONG A SHALLOW TO UPPER-MESOPHOTIC DEPTH GRADIENT (13-71 M) AT A SUBMERGED, OFFSHORE SHOAL IN THE NORTHERN GREAT BARRIER REEF. BRUVS WERE DEPLOYED DURING TWO SEPARATE TIME PERIODS (FEBRUARY AND AUGUST 2017), TO SEPARATELY EXAMINE PATTERNS OF DEPTH USE.

WE OBSERVED EXTENSIVE FIELDS OF FILAMENTOUS CYANOBACTERIA-LIKE MATS COVERING SANDY SUBSTRATES AND MOSTLY DEAD MESOPHOTIC LEPTOSERIS SPP. REEFS. THESE MATS COVERED UP TO 100\% OF THE SEAFLOOR OFF HANGA ROA, THE MAIN VILLAGE ON THE ISLAND, LOCATED ON ITS WESTERN SIDE. THE HIGHEST MORTALITY OF CORALS WAS OBSERVED AT DEPTHS BETWEEN 70 AND 95 M IN THIS AREA. HEALTHY LEPTOSERIS REEFS WERE DOCUMENTED OFF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN SIDES OF THE ISLAND, WHICH ARE ALSO THE LEAST POPULATED. A PRELIMINARY MORPHOLOGIC ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES OF THE MATS INDICATED THAT THE ASSEMBLAGE IS COMPOSED OF AT LEAST FOUR FILAMENTOUS TAXA, INCLUDING TWO CYANOBACTERIA (CF. LYNGBYA SP.

WE ASSESSED COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF THE OVERALL BENTHIC COMMUNITY FROM 0 TO 300 M VIA NON-METRIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING (NMDS) OF SPECIES PRESENCE ACROSS DEPTH BANDS. WE USED THE JACCARD INDEX OF SIMILARITY TO CALCULATE THE PROPORTION OF SHARED SPECIES BETWEEN ADJACENT DEPTH BANDS, MEASURE SPECIES TURNOVER WITH DEPTH, AND ASSESS TAXONOMIC OVERLAP BETWEEN SHALLOW REEFS VERSUS PROGRESSIVELY DEEPER DEPTH BANDS. NMDS ORDINATIONS SHOWED THAT THE TRADITIONALLY DEFINED MESOPHOTIC RANGE (30-150 M) AS A WHOLE IS NOT A DISTINCT COMMUNITY. IN CONTRAST, TAXONOMICALLY DISTINCT COMMUNITIES, DETERMINED BY HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING, WERE FOUND AT 0-70, 60-120, 110-200, AND 190-300 M. CLUSTERING HIGHLIGHTED AN IMPORTANT SEPARATION IN THE BENTHIC COMMUNITY AT SIMILAR TO 60 M, WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR ACTINOPTERYGIAN FISHES. SPECIES TURNOVER BETWEEN ADJACENT DEPTHS DECREASED WITH DEPTH FOR ALL TAXA COMBINED AND INDIVIDUAL TAXA, WITH PEAKS AT SIMILAR TO 60, 90-120, AND 190-200 M. FISHES SHOWED LOWER TURNOVER FROM SHALLOW TO UPPER MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS (0-50 M) THAN ALL TAXA COMBINED, A SUBSTANTIAL PEAK AT 60 M, FOLLOWED BY A PRECIPITOUS AND CONTINUED DECLINE IN TURNOVER THEREAFTER. TAXONOMIC OVERLAP BETWEEN SHALLOW (0-20 M) AND PROGRESSIVELY DEEPER ZONES DECLINED STEADILY WITH DEPTH IN ALL TAXA AND INDIVIDUAL TAXA, SUGGESTING THAT MID- AND LOWER MESOPHOTIC HABITATS HAVE LESS (BUT NOT INCONSEQUENTIAL) POTENTIAL TO SERVE AS REFUGIA (60-150 M, 15-25\% OVERLAP WITH SHALLOW HABITATS) THAN UPPER MESOPHOTIC ZONES (30-60 M, 30-45\% OVERLAP WITH SHALLOW HABITATS) FOR ALL TAXA COMBINED. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE TRADITIONAL MESOPHOTIC ZONE IS HOME TO THREE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES IN THE GOMX, ONE THAT IS CONFLUENT WITH SHALLOW REEFS, A DISTINCT MESOPHOTIC ASSEMBLAGE SPANNING 60-120 M, AND A THIRD THAT EXTENDS ONTO THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.",10.1007/s00338-016-1530-0,SEMMLER RF_2017_CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,

TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, NINE POLYMORPHIC DNA MICROSATELLITE LOCI WERE DEVELOPED AND USED TO ASSESS VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY IN 583 CORAL COLONIES OF THE CARIBBEAN DEPTH-GENERALIST CORAL MONTASTRAEA CAVERNOSA. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THREE DEPTH ZONES (<= 10, 15-20 AND >= 25 M) AT SITES IN FLORIDA (WITHIN THE UPPER KEYS, LOWER KEYS AND DRY TORTUGAS), BERMUDA, AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. MIGRATION RATES WERE ESTIMATED TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF CORAL LARVAL MIGRATION FROM SHALLOW TO DEEP AND FROM DEEP TO SHALLOW. FINALLY, ALGAL SYMBIONT (SYMBIODINIUM SPP.) DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION WERE ASSESSED IN A SUBSET OF CORALS TO TEST WHETHER SYMBIONT DEPTH ZONATION MIGHT INDICATE LIMITED VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY. OVERALL, ANALYSES REVEALED SIGNIFICANT GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BY DEPTH IN FLORIDA, BUT NOT IN BERMUDA OR THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF HORIZONTAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THESE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AT SHALLOW DEPTHS. WITHIN FLORIDA, GREATER VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE DRY TORTUGAS COMPARED TO THE LOWER OR UPPER KEYS. HOWEVER, AT ALL SITES, AND REGARDLESS OF THE EXTENT OF VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY, MIGRATION OCCURRED ASYMMETRICALLY, WITH GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF MIGRATION FROM SHALLOW TO INTERMEDIATE/DEEP HABITATS. FINALLY, MOST COLONIES HOSTED A SINGLE SYMBIODINIUM TYPE (C3), RULING OUT SYMBIONT DEPTH ZONATION OF THE DOMINANT SYMBIONT TYPE AS A STRUCTURING FACTOR.

UNLIKE THOSE LIMESTONE-RICH INTERVALS, THE LATE MIOCENE SUCCESSION IN WELL XK1 IS CHARACTERIZED BY DOLOMITIZED LIMESTONES WITH A LOW DEPOSITION RATE (30-60 M/MA POST-COMPACTION).

HERE, WE DESIGNED AND TESTED THE PERFORMANCE OF A PORTABLE, SUBMERSIBLE HYPERBARIC CHAMBER, THE SUBCAS, WHICH WE USED TO SAFELY SURFACE REEF FISHES FROM MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. DURING SIX EXPEDITIONS BETWEEN 2014 AND 2017 TO THE PHILIPPINES, VANUATU, PALAU AND POHNPEI, WE ASSESSED THE SURVIVAL OF 174 FISHES CAUGHT BETWEEN 60 AND 150 M DEPTH AND DECOMPRESSED USING THIS CHAMBER.

SURVIVAL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO TAXONOMIC FAMILY, WITH POMACENTRIDAE AND APOGONIDAE SHOWING THE HIGHEST MORTALITY. COLLECTION DEPTH, FISH BODY SIZE, AND LENGTH OF DECOMPRESSION HAD NO RELATION TO SURVIVORSHIP. SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL DECOMPRESSION EVENTS AND BOTH FISH BODY SIZE AND TAXONOMIC FAMILY INDICATE THAT LOW SURVIVAL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC SUBCAS TRIALS.

AMID EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE THEIR DECLINE, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT MESOPHOTIC REEFS MIGHT SERVE AS NATURAL REFUGES AND A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF PROPAGULES FOR THE SHALLOW REEFS. HOWEVER, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF CORALS ALTERS WITH DEPTH IS SPARSE. HERE, WE PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY, FECUNDITY, AND ABUNDANCE OF SEVEN REEF-BUILDING CONSPECIFIC CORALS IN SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC HABITATS. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE SYNCHRONY AND TIMING OF GAMETOGENESIS AND SPAWNING BETWEEN SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC CORAL POPULATIONS. THUS, MESOPHOTIC POPULATIONS EXHIBITED DELAYED OR PROTRACTED SPAWNING EVENTS, WHICH LED TO SPAWNING OF THE MESOPHOTIC COLONIES IN LARGE PROPORTIONS AT TIMES WHERE THE SHALLOW ONES HAD LONG BEEN DEPLETED OF REPRODUCTIVE MATERIAL. ALL SPECIES INVESTIGATED DEMONSTRATED A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN FECUNDITY AND/OR OOCYTE SIZES AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS (40-60M). TWO SPECIES (SERIATOPORA HYSTRIX AND GALAXEA FASCICULARIS) DISPLAYED A REDUCTION IN BOTH FECUNDITY AND OOCYTE SIZE AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS. TURBINARIA RENIFORMIS HAD ONLY REDUCED FECUNDITY AND ACROPORA SQUARROSA AND ACROPORA VALIDA ONLY REDUCED OOCYTE SIZE. IN MONTIPORA VERRUCOSA, REDUCED FECUNDITY WAS FOUND DURING ONE ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE SEASON WHILE, IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR, ONLY REDUCED OOCYTE SIZE WAS FOUND. IN CONTRAST, REDUCED OOCYTE SIZE IN MESOPHOTIC POPULATIONS OF ACROPORA SQUARROSA WAS CONSISTENT ALONG THREE STUDIED YEARS. ONE SPECIES, ACROPORA PHARAONIS, WAS FOUND TO BE INFERTILE AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS ALONG TWO STUDIED YEARS. THIS INDICATES THAT REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE DECREASES WITH DEPTH; AND THAT ALTHOUGH SOME SPECIES ARE CAPABLE OF REPRODUCING AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS, THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE REPLENISHMENT OF SHALLOW REEFS MAY BE INCONSEQUENTIAL. REDUCED REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE WITH DEPTH, COMBINED WITH THE POSSIBLE NARROWER TOLERANCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT MESOPHOTIC CORALS MAY IN FACT BE MORE VULNERABLE THAN PREVIOUSLY CONCEIVED. FURTHERMORE, WE POSIT THAT THE OBSERVED TEMPORAL SEGREGATION IN REPRODUCTION COULD LEAD TO ASSORTATIVE MATING, AND THIS, IN TURN, MAY FACILITATE ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE ACROSS DEPTH.",10.1002/ecy.2098,SHLESINGER T_2018_ECOLOGY,,,,,,,

CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE FORMATION OF THE CRYSTALLITES, WHICH LITHIFY THE SCLERITES, IS CAUSED BY A NON-BIOGENIC ARAGONITE PRECIPITATION, AND THAT THE LIVING COLONY MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THIS PROTRUDING SPICULITE STRUCTURE BY MEANS OF ENHANCED EXPOSURE TO WATER FLOW.",10.1038/s41598-018-37696-z,SHOHAM E_2019_SCI REP,,,,,,,

HEREIN, WE ANALYZE CHANGES IN REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN A CROSS-SHELF EUPHOTIC-MESOPHOTIC (19-72.6 M) GRADIENT IN TROPICAL SW ATLANTIC. DATA WAS OBTAINED USING A NOVEL LOW-COST 360 DEGREES STATIONARY VIDEO SYSTEM. SIXTY-FOUR SPECIES FROM THIRTY FAMILIES WERE IDENTIFIED. DEPTH, DISTANCE OFFSHORE AND PROPORTION OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSTRATE WERE THE MAIN PREDICTORS OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES' STRUCTURE. FOUR DISTINCT FISH ASSEMBLAGES WERE IDENTIFIED ACROSS THE DEPTH GRADIENT (20-30, 30-40, 40-50 AND 50-75 M), WITH MARKED SHIFTS IN COMPOSITION, ABUNDANCE, AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE. ABUNDANCE OF INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS AND LARGE ROVING HERBIVORES DECLINED ACROSS THE SHELF AND WITH INCREASING DEPTH, WHILE ABUNDANCE OF PLANKTIVORES AND PISCIVORES INCREASED, PARTICULARLY BELOW 50 M. THESE CHANGES WERE LIKELY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN FOOD AVAILABILITY AND HABITAT SUITABILITY. OUR LOW-COST VIDEO SYSTEM YIELDED HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGES THAT ENABLED US TO ACCURATELY SURVEY REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES, BEING THEREFORE A USEFUL METHOD FOR STUDIES FOCUSING ON BOTH, EUPHOTIC AND MESOPHOTIC REEF ECOSYSTEMS. OUR RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES CHANGE WITH INCREASING DEPTH IN SW ATLANTIC REEFS AND CORROBORATE THE IDEA THAT THE BREAKPOINT BETWEEN EUPHOTIC AND MESOPHOTIC FISH ASSEMBLAGES IS CONTEXTDEPENDENT RATHER THAN PREVIOUSLY DEFINED AS 30 M DEPTH.",10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107465,SILVA MB_2021_ESTUAR COAST SHELF SCI,,,,,,,

HOWEVER, THEIR ROLE AS A SUBSEQUENT SOURCE OF LARVAE REMAINS UNCLEAR FOR MANY SPECIES, PARTICULARLY AS GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION OF CORALS OVER DEPTH HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN OBSERVED. IN 1998 AND 2001, TWO SEVERE BLEACHING EVENTS AROUND OKINAWA ISLAND IN JAPAN RESULTED IN MAJOR CHANGES TO THE SHALLOW REEFS, INCLUDING THE LOCAL ``EXTINCTION'' OF SPECIES SUCH AS SERIATOPORA HYSTRBC AT SESOKO ISLAND. HOWEVER, RECENTLY THIS SPECIES WAS FOUND TO BE PRESENT IN ABUNDANCE AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS IN THE AREA, DESPITE NO CLEAR SIGNS OF RECOVERY BEING OBSERVED IN THE ADJACENT SHALLOW WATERS. HERE, WE ASSESSED THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF SERIATOPORA FROM THIS DEEP POPULATION AND PROVIDE A COMPARISON WITH POPULATIONS FROM SHALLOW TO MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE RYUKYU ARCHIPELAGO, TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DEPTH SPECIFICITY AND THEIR IMPORTANCE IN GENETIC DIVERSITY CONSERVATION OF AFFECTED SHALLOW POPULATIONS.

HERE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT HOST PIGMENTS, SPECIFICALLY PHOTOCONVERTIBLE RED FLUORESCENT PROTEINS (PCRFPS), CAN PROMOTE CORAL ADAPTATION/ACCLIMATIZATION TO DEEPER-WATER LIGHT ENVIRONMENTS BY TRANSFORMING THE PREVALENT BLUE LIGHT INTO ORANGE-RED LIGHT, WHICH CAN PENETRATE DEEPER WITHIN ZOOXANTHELLAE-CONTAINING TISSUES; THIS FACILITATES A MORE HOMOGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTONS ACROSS SYMBIONT COMMUNITIES. THE ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF PCRFPS IN DEEPER REEFS IS SUPPORTED BY THE INCREASING PROPORTION OF RED FLUORESCENT CORALS WITH DEPTH (MEASURED DOWN TO 45 M) AND INCREASED SURVIVAL OF COLOUR MORPHS WITH STRONG EXPRESSION OF PCRFPS IN LONG-TERM LIGHT MANIPULATION EXPERIMENTS. IN ADDITION TO SCREENING BY HOST PIGMENTS FROM HIGH LIGHT INTENSITIES IN SHALLOW WATER, THE SPECTRAL TRANSFORMATION OBSERVED IN DEEPER-WATER CORALS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GFP-LIKE PROTEIN EXPRESSION AS AN ECOLOGICAL MECHANISM TO SUPPORT THE FUNCTIONING OF THE CORAL-SYMBIODINIUM ASSOCIATION ACROSS STEEP ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS.",10.1098/rspb.2017.0320,SMITH EG_2017_PROC R SOC B-BIOL SCI,,,,,,,

DESPITE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS THESE ARTIFICIAL HABITATS MAY HAVE ON MARINE FISHERIES, INVESTIGATIONS THAT ASSESS THE FISH COMMUNITIES INHABITING THESE STRUCTURES RELATIVE TO NATURAL HABITATS ARE RARE. DURING FALL 2012, WE USED REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE SURVEYS TO COMPARE FISH COMMUNITIES BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL REEFS (I.E., REEFED PLATFORMS; N = 5) AND ADJACENT NATURAL BANKS (N = 5) IN THE WESTERN GOM. OUR SURVEYS SUCCESSFULLY DOCUMENTED 79 SPECIES REPRESENTING 28 FAMILIES. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES SUGGESTED THAT FISH COMMUNITIES AT ARTIFICIAL REEFS WERE DISTINCT FROM THOSE AT NATURAL BANKS. POST HOC ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE DIFFERENCES WERE DRIVEN BY HIGH ABUNDANCES OF TRANSIENT, MIDWATER PELAGICS AND OTHER GREGARIOUS SPECIES AT ARTIFICIAL REEFS. MANY FISHERIES SPECIES, LIKE THE RED SNAPPER LUTJANUS CAMPECHANUS, WERE FOUND IN BOTH HABITAT TYPES, WITH DENSITY AT ARTIFICIAL REEFS ESTIMATED TO BE NEARLY EIGHT TIMES GREATER THAN AT NATURAL BANKS.

MESOPHOTIC CORALS THAT INHABIT DEPTHS OF APPROXIMATELY 30-150 M ARE EXPECTED TO SURVIVE BLEACHING EVENTS AND RESEED SHALLOW WATER CORALS AFTERWARD. IN OKINAWA, JAPAN, MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO SERVE AS A REFUGE FOR PRESERVING THE GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY OF BLEACHING-SENSITIVE CORALS. THE CONNECTIVITY OF LARVAL POPULATIONS AMONG DIFFERENT HABITATS IS A KEY ELEMENT THAT DETERMINES THE AREA TO BE CONSERVED IN DESIRABLE CORAL ECOSYSTEMS. BECAUSE CORAL LARVAE ARE LARGELY TRANSPORTED PASSIVELY BY AMBIENT OCEANIC CURRENTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE HORIZONTAL DIRECTION, NUMERICAL OCEAN CIRCULATION MODELS GREATLY HELP TO QUANTIFY CONNECTIVITY WITH DETAILED SPATIOTEMPORAL NETWORK STRUCTURES. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO QUANTIFY THE SHORT-DISTANCE CONNECTIVITY OF SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC CORAL LARVAE IN REEF AREAS ON THE NORTHWEST COAST OF OKINAWA ISLAND. TO THIS END, A QUADRUPLE NESTED HIGH-RESOLUTION SYNOPTIC OCEAN MODEL AT A LATERAL SPATIAL GRID RESOLUTION OF 50 M WAS DEVELOPED, WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF REALIZING DETAILED COASTAL CURRENTS INFLUENCED BY COMPLEX NEARSHORE TOPOGRAPHY, AND COUPLED WITH AN OFFLINE 3-D LAGRANGIAN PARTICLE-TRACKING MODEL. AFTER VALIDATING THE DEVELOPED MODEL, SHORT-DISTANCE HORIZONTAL CORAL CONNECTIVITY ACROSS REEF AREAS ON THE NORTHWEST COAST WAS SUCCESSFULLY EVALUATED. THE ALONGSHORE LATERAL CONNECTIVITY HAD APPARENT ASYMMETRY CAUSED BY DEPTH-DEPENDENT HORIZONTAL CURRENTS, WHEREAS THE LARVAE SPAWNED AT SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS WERE REACHABLE TO EACH OTHER. SUCH ACROSS-DEPTH LARVAL DISPERSAL WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MIXED-LAYER DEPTH IN THE SPAWNING PERIOD, VIZ., THE BOREAL SPRING, WHICH APPROXIMATELY COINCIDES WITH THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC CORAL, LEADING TO THE INTENSIVE VERTICAL EXCHANGE OF VIRTUAL LARVAE.",10.3389/fmars.2023.1174940,TAKEYASU K_2023_FRONT MAR SCI,,,,,,,

CURRENTLY, A 30 M DEPTH LIMIT, BASED ON SCUBA REGULATIONS, SEPARATES SHALLOW AND DEEP MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS (MCES). THIS DEFINITION, HOWEVER, FAILS TO EXPLICITLY ACCOMMODATE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION. HERE, WE POSIT A NOVEL DEFINITION FOR A REGIONAL OR REEF-TO-REEF OUTLOOK OF MCES BASED ON THE LIGHT VS. CORAL COMMUNITY-STRUCTURE RELATIONSHIP. A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL METHODS ENABLED US TO CLARIFY THE AMBIGUITY IN RELATION TO THE MESOPHOTIC DEFINITION. TO CHARACTERIZE CORAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WITH RESPECT TO THE LIGHT ENVIRONMENT, WE CONDUCTED WIDE-SCALE SPATIAL STUDIES AT FIVE SITES ALONG SHALLOW AND MCES OF THE GULF OF EILAT/AQABA (0-100 M DEPTH). SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED BY TECHNICAL-DIVING AND DROP-CAMERAS, IN ADDITION TO ONE YEAR OF LIGHT SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS. WE QUANTIFY TWO DISTINCT CORAL ASSEMBLAGES: SHALLOW (<40 M) AND MCES (40-100 M), EXHIBITING MARKEDLY DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH LIGHT. THE DEPTH RANGES AND MORPHOLOGY OF 47 CORAL GENERA WERE BETTER EXPLAINED BY LIGHT THAN DEPTH, MAINLY, DUE TO PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION (PAR) AND ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION (UVR) (1\% AT 76 AND 36 M, RESPECTIVELY). BRANCHING CORAL SPECIES WERE FOUND MAINLY AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS, THAT IS, DOWN TO 36 M. AMONG THE ABUNDANT UPPER-MESOPHOTIC SPECIALIST CORALS, LEPTOSERIS GLABRA, EUPHYLLIA PARADIVISA, AND ALVEOPORA SPP. WERE FOUND STRICTLY BETWEEN 40 AND 80 M DEPTH. THE ONLY LOWER-MESOPHOTIC SPECIALIST, LEPTOSERIS FRAGILIS, WAS FOUND DEEPER THAN 80 M. WE SUGGEST THAT SHALLOW CORAL GENERA ARE LIGHT-LIMITED BELOW A LEVEL OF 1.25\% SURFACE PAR AND THAT THE OPTIMAL PAR FOR MESOPHOTIC COMMUNITIES IS AT 7.5\%.

IN THIS CONTEXT, THE IDENTIFICATION OF KEY AND FRAGILE HABITAT-FORMING SPECIES IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. DESPITE THEIR ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE, WHIP CORALS IN THE ORDER ANTIPATHARIA REMAIN POORLY STUDIED AROUND THE WORLD, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC. DURING RECENT EXPEDITIONS TO EXPLORE MESOPHOTIC AND DEEP BENTHIC HABITATS AROUND RAPA NUI (EASTER ISLAND), DENSE ASSEMBLAGES OF WHIP BLACK CORALS WERE OBSERVED IN SITU. WE HERE REPORT THE FIRST DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF THESE BLACK CORAL ASSEMBLAGES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED FAUNA AND HABITAT. THESE DESCRIPTIONS WERE BASED ON ANALYSIS OF VIDEO SURVEYS COLLECTED ON 67 REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE DIVES CONDUCTED IN 2014 THROUGH 2019 AT THREE SITES (PUKAO SEAMOUNT, APOLO PEAK, AND RAPA NUI ISLAND SHELF AND SLOPE) WITHIN THE EASTER ISLAND ECOREGION AT DEPTHS BETWEEN 50 AND 330 M. AT LEAST FOUR MORPHOTYPES (YELLOW, RED, WHITE/ORANGE, AND PUKAO) OF UNBRANCHED BLACK CORALS WERE DETECTED. EACH MORPHOTYPE HAD POLYPS ARRANGED IN A SINGLE ROW ON ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE CORALLUM, A DIAGNOSTIC MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTER CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE ANTIPATHARIAN GENUS STICHOPATHES. SAMPLES OF THE YELLOW AND RED MORPHOTYPES WERE COLLECTED AND STUDIED USING MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES. THESE ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THE GENUS STICHOPATHES IS NOT MONOPHYLETIC AND REQUIRES FURTHER REVISIONS, A CONCLUSION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES. EXTENSIVE FIELDS OF WHIP BLACK CORALS, PRIMARILY OF THE YELLOW AND RED MORPHOTYPE, WERE PRESENT AT 28 SITES FROM 60 TO 245 M ON ROCKY SUBSTRATES, COARSE SAND, OR RHODOLITHS. DENSITIES OF THESE ASSEMBLAGES PER FRAME WERE UP TO 58.2 +/- 5.2 COLONIES M(-2) (AVERAGE: 13.2 +/ - 0.8), WHICH REPRESENT SOME OF THE HIGHEST REPORTED DENSITIES FOR BLACK CORALS TO DATE. NUMEROUS FAUNAL GROUPS, INCLUDING OPHIUROIDS, ECHINOIDS, AND FISHES, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE WHIP BLACK CORAL ASSEMBLAGES.

WITH A WIDTH OF ABOUT 5 KM, THE STEEP-SIDED BANK RISES FROM WATER DEPTHS OF OVER 100 M TO WITHIN LESS THAN 20 M OF THE SURFACE. FOUR ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER (ADCP) MOORINGS AND FOUR TEMPERATURE/SALINITY STRINGS WERE DEPLOYED AROUND THE EFGB WITH AN ADDITIONAL ADCP ON TOP OF THE BANK FOR ABOUT 1 YEAR. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE OCEAN PROCESSES OVER THE EFGB AND TO EXAMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TOPOGRAPHICALLY INDUCED PROCESSES ON SHELF EDGE CIRCULATION ON LONGER (E.G. DAYS TO SEASONAL) TIME SCALES. CURRENTS WERE GENERALLY EASTWARD OVER THE BANK IN THE UPPER WATER COLUMN. EDDY EVENTS OCCASIONALLY REVERSED THE EASTWARD FLOW FOR A FEW DAYS. CURRENTS IN THE LOWER WATER COLUMN TENDED TO ALIGN WITH THE BANK'S BATHYMETRY AND MOSTLY WERE DIRECTED OFFSHORE AT THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE BANK. WIND AND EDDY EVENTS MOVED BOTH SHELF AND OFF-SHELF WATERS OVER THE BANK, INCLUDING WATERS FROM AS DEEP AS 200 M THROUGH UPWELLING AND/OR MIXING PROCESSES. MIXED LAYERS CHANGED BY AS MUCH AS 50 M IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. INERTIAL CURRENTS OCCURRED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND WERE OFTEN MUCH LARGER THAN THE TIDAL CURRENTS. COMMONLY, THE INERTIAL CURRENTS WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO REVERSE THE PREDOMINANTLY EASTWARD CURRENT FLOW ON TIME SCALES OF LESS THAN A DAY. WESTWARD PROPAGATING CYCLONIC EDDIES (OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH ANTICYCLONIC EDDIES) LIKELY CONNECT BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE EFGB WITH THE WEST FLOWER GARDEN BANK. BANKS SUCH AS THE EFGB, WITH LARGE ASPECT RATIOS AND HEIGHTS, STRONGLY ALTER CIRCULATION AND ENHANCE EXCHANGE PROCESSES AT THE SHELF BREAK.

AKIN TO DEEP MESOPHOTIC REEFS AND REEFS IN THERMALLY STRESSED REGIONS, LOW DIVERSITY, TURBID-ZONE REEFS MAY EXHIBIT HIGH BLEACHING TOLERANCE DUE TO LOCAL ADAPTATIONS AND CONDITIONS (E.G., SHADING BY TURBIDITY). HERE, WE SUMMARIZE PREVIOUS BLEACHING EVENTS IN THE TROPICAL WESTERN SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN AND EXPLORE TAXONOMIC, CROSS-SHELF AND HABITAT-RELATED BLEACHING TRENDS IN THE ABROLHOS REEFS IN FEBRUARY, MAY, JUNE AND OCTOBER 2016, AND MARCH 2017. FIRE CORALS (MILLEPORA SPP.) WERE THE MOST AFFECTED, BUT ALL SCLERACTINIAN SPECIES AND SEVERAL OCTOCORALS AND ZOANTHIDS ALSO BLEACHED. BLEACHING PREVALENCE WAS HIGHER IN SHALLOW COASTAL AND OFFSHORE REEF ARCS THAN IN DEEPER MESOPHOTIC REEFS. ALL CORAL SPECIES BLEACHED, BUT THERE WERE TAXONOMIC AND HABITAT-RELATED TRENDS IN BLEACHING PREVALENCE. SEVERAL SPECIES BLEACHED LESS IN THE SITES AND HABITATS WHERE THEIR ABUNDANCE WAS LOWER. AS OF MARCH 2017, CORAL MORTALITY WAS OVERALL LOW ACROSS THE REGION (< 3\% OF TOTAL CORAL COVER). OUR RESULTS ADD TO THE RECENT EVIDENCE THAT DEEP REEFS PROVIDE PARTIAL REFUGIA FOR A FEW CORAL SPECIES, AND THAT TURBID-ZONE REEFS MAY BE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CLIMATE STRESS DUE TO SHADING, HIGHER HETEROTROPHY LEVELS, AND LOCAL ADAPTATIONS.",10.1007/s00338-019-01789-6,TEIXEIRA CD_2019_CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,

HOWEVER, HORIZONTAL CONNECTIVITY HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF FEW STUDIES, AND DATA ON VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY ARE LIMITED TO SESSILE BENTHIC MESOPHOTIC ORGANISMS. HERE WE PRESENT PATTERNS OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS-JOHNSTON ATOLL ENDEMIC THREESPOT DAMSELFISH, CHROMIS VERATER, BASED ON 319 SHALLOW SPECIMENS AND 153 DEEP SPECIMENS. THE MTDNA MARKERS CYTOCHROME B AND CONTROL REGION WERE SEQUENCED TO ANALYZE GENETIC STRUCTURE: 1) BETWEEN SHALLOW (<30 M) AND MESOPHOTIC (30-150 M) POPULATIONS AND 2) ACROSS THE SPECIES' GEOGRAPHIC RANGE. ADDITIONALLY, THE NUCLEAR MARKERS RHODOPSIN AND INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER 2 OF RIBOSOMAL DNA WERE SEQUENCED TO ASSESS CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN SHALLOW AND MESOPHOTIC POPULATIONS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BY DEPTH, INDICATING HIGH LEVELS OF VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN SHALLOW AND DEEP AGGREGATES OF C. VERATER. CONSEQUENTLY, SHALLOW AND DEEP SAMPLES WERE COMBINED BY LOCATION FOR ANALYSES OF HORIZONTAL CONNECTIVITY. WE DETECTED LOW BUT SIGNIFICANT POPULATION STRUCTURE ACROSS THE HAWAIIAN ARCHIPELAGO (OVERALL CYTOCHROME B: PHI(ST)=0.009, P=0.020; CONTROL REGION: PHI(ST)=0.012, P=0.009) AND A LARGER BREAK BETWEEN THE ARCHIPELAGO AND JOHNSTON ATOLL (CYTOCHROME B: PHI(ST)=0.068, P<0.001; CONTROL REGION: PHI(ST)=0.116, P<0.001). THE POPULATION STRUCTURE WITHIN THE ARCHIPELAGO WAS DRIVEN BY SAMPLES FROM THE ISLAND OF HAWAII AT THE SOUTHEAST END OF THE CHAIN AND LISIANSKI IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARCHIPELAGO.

WITH OCEAN WARMING THREATENING CORAL REEFS WORLDWIDE, A PANOPTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF CORALS LIVING IN EXTREME CONDITIONS MAY PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO FUTURE RESPONSES OF CORALS TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GENOTYPE OF THE ENDOSYMBIOTIC ALGAE IN THE FAMILY SYMBIODINIACEAE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND RESILIENCE OF THEIR CORAL HOSTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIM AT GENOTYPING THE SYMBIODINIACEAE COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THREE DEPTH GENERALIST AND ONE DEPTH SPECIALIST CORAL SPECIES, CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE APPARENTLY LIMITING FOR OTHER CORALS AND OCCURRING IN A UNIQUE GEOGRAPHICAL REGION. METHODSWE SAMPLED 50 CORALS FROM THE NORTHERN SAUDI ARABIAN RED SEA AND THE GULF OF AQABA, COVERING A 97 M BATHYMETRIC GRADIENT. WE USED HIGH-THROUGHPUT ITS2 GENE SEQUENCING AND RECOVERED DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF HOST-ALGAL ASSOCIATIONS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTHE MAJORITY OF THE RECOVERED ALGAL GENOTYPES APPEARED HOST- AND ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC, WHILE OTHERS WERE MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED. AT LARGE, CORAL SPECIMENS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH SYMBIONTS FROM THE GENUS CLADOCOPIUM AND SPECIFICALLY WITH MANY PREVIOUSLY UNDESCRIBED GENOTYPES. THIS SUGGESTS THE SELECTION OF SPECIFIC GENOTYPES, WHICH MIGHT CONFER RESISTANCE AND/OR RESILIENCE TO THEIR HOST COUNTERPARTS. INTERESTINGLY, WE FOUND A LIMITED ASSOCIATION WITH DURUSDINIUM SPP. AND OTHER KNOWN TOLERANT TAXA IN MESOPHOTIC CORALS IN THE NORTHERN RED SEA, BUT NOT IN THE GULF OF AQABA. THE BROAD ABSENCE OF DURUSDINIUM SPP., TYPICALLY ASCRIBED TO BE STRESS TOLERANT, WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO SYMBIODINIACEAE SPECIES THAT CONVEY ENVIRONMENTAL RESILIENCE.

SIMILAR TO OTHER MARINE UNDERWATER FORESTS, BLACK CORAL GARDENS HOST A RICH ASSOCIATED FAUNA AND ATTRACT NUMEROUS SPECIES OF COMMERCIAL INTEREST. AS SUCH, THESE CORALS ARE TARGETED BY RECREATIONAL AND ARTISANAL FISHERIES AND ARE VULNERABLE TO HUMAN IMPACT DUE TO THEIR ARBORESCENT MORPHOLOGY AND LOW GROWTH RATES. GENETIC CONNECTIVITY CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESSES OF POPULATION MAINTENANCE AND REPLENISHMENT FOLLOWING ENVIRONMENTAL DISTURBANCE AND IS OFTEN USED AS A PROXY FOR POPULATION RESILIENCE. IN OUR STUDY, A RESTRICTION-SITE ASSOCIATED DNA ANALYSIS (2BRAD) WAS USED TO EVALUATE FINESCALE POPULATION STRUCTURE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN BLACK CORAL A. SUBPINNATA, AND TO UNDERSTAND WHICH POPULATIONS COULD SERVE AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF GENETIC DIVERSITY FOR ADJACENT POPULATIONS. COLONIES FROM TWO OFFSHORE LOCALITIES (A LIGURIAN SEAMOUNT AND A TYRRHENIAN CANYON) AND FOUR COASTAL POPULATIONS FROM LIGURIA AND SICILY WERE SAMPLED AND GENOTYPED. SIGNIFICANT GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION WAS RECORDED BETWEEN COASTAL AND OFFSHORE LOCALITIES. MOREOVER, OFFSHORE LOCALITIES WERE GENETICALLY DISTINCT FROM ONE ANOTHER, WHILE ALL COASTAL POPULATIONS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY PANMIXIA. THIS INDICATES THAT OFFSHORE A. SUBPINNATA GARDENS ARE POTENTIALLY LESS RESILIENT TO HUMAN IMPACT (I.E., DEMERSAL FISHING ACTIVITIES) DUE TO A LIMITED INFLUX OF LARVAE FROM ADJACENT HABITATS. IN ADDITION, THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO SUPPLY CORAL PROPAGULES TO COASTAL POPULATIONS. OVERALL, THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE VULNERABILITY OF MEDITERRANEAN A.

DUE TO THESE MARKED DIFFERENCES, SLENDER AND STOCKY MORPHOTYPES WERE HYPOTHESIZED TO BE TWO SPECIES. HERE, WE USED 2BRAD TO OBTAIN GENOME-WIDE GENOTYPED SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) TO INVESTIGATE THE GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN SLENDER AND STOCKY MORPHS, AS WELL AS THEIR POPULATION STRUCTURE. A TOTAL OF 101 SPECIMENS OF P. AXINELLAE WERE SAMPLED AND GENOTYPED FROM EIGHT LOCATIONS ALONG THE ITALIAN COASTLINE. IN FOUR LOCATIONS, SAMPLES OF THE TWO MORPHOTYPES WERE COLLECTED IN SYMPATRY. 2BRAD GENOME-WIDE SNPS WERE USED TO ASSESS THE GENETIC DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MORPHOTYPES (1319 SNPS), AND POPULATION CONNECTIVITY PATTERNS WITHIN SLENDER (1926 SNPS) AND STOCKY (1871 SNPS) MORPHOTYPES. MARKED AND CONSISTENT DIFFERENTIATION WAS DETECTED BETWEEN SLENDER AND STOCKY MORPHOTYPES. THE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED SLENDER MORPHOTYPE SHOWED HIGHER POPULATION MIXING PATTERNS, WHILE POPULATIONS OF THE STOCKY MORPHOTYPE EXHIBITED A STRONGER GENETIC STRUCTURE AT A REGIONAL SCALE. THE STRONG GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION OBSERVED BETWEEN P. AXINELLAE SLENDER AND STOCKY MORPHOTYPES PROVIDES ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THESE MORPHS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENT SPECIES, ALTHOUGH FURTHER MORPHOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO VALIDATE THIS HYPOTHESIS.

ANALYSES OF THE SEAFLOOR MORPHOLOGY SHOW THAT THE GULF HEAD CAN BE SUBDIVIDED INTO THE EILAT AND AQABA SUBBASINS SEPARATED BY THE NORTH-SOUTH-TRENDING AYLA HIGH. THE AQABA SUBMARINE BASIN APPEARS STARVED OF SEDIMENT SUPPLY, APPARENTLY CAUSING EROSION AND A LANDWARD RETREAT OF THE SHELF EDGE. ALONG THE EASTERN BORDER OF THIS SUBBASIN, THE SHELF IS LARGELY ABSENT AND ITS MARGIN IS INFLUENCED BY THE AQABA FAULT ZONE THAT FORMS A STEEP SLOPE PARTIALLY COVERED BY SEDIMENTARY FAN DELTAS FROM THE ADJACENT EPHEMERAL DRAINAGES. THE EILAT SUBBASIN, WEST OF THE AYLA HIGH, RECEIVES A LARGE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT DERIVED FROM THE EXTENSIVE DRAINAGE BASINS OF THE ARAVA VALLEY (WADI `ARABAH) AND YUTIM RIVER TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST. THESE SEDIMENTS AND THOSE ENTERING FROM CANYONS ON THE SOUTH-WESTERN BORDER OF THIS SUBBASIN ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE DEEP BASIN BY TURBIDITY CURRENTS AND GRAVITY SLIDES, FORMING THE ARAVA SUBMARINE FAN. LARGE DETACHED BLOCKS AND COLLAPSED WALLS OF SUBMARINE CANYONS AND THE WESTERN GULF MARGIN INDICATE THAT MASS WASTING MAY BE TRIGGERED BY SEISMIC ACTIVITY. SEAFLOOR LINEAMENTS DEFINED BY SLOPE GRADIENT ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT THE EILAT CANYON AND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE AYLA HIGH ALIGN ALONG NORTH- TO NORTHWEST-STRIKING FAULT SYSTEMS-THE EVRONA FAULT ZONE TO THE WEST AND THE AYLA FAULT ZONE TO THE EAST. THE SHELF-SLOPE BREAK THAT LIES ALONG THE 100 M ISOBATH IN THE EILAT SUBBASIN, AND SHALLOWER (70-80 M ISOBATHS) IN THE AQABA SUBBASIN, IS OFFSET BY APPROX. 150 M ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE AYLA HIGH.

ALTHOUGH GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES MAY BE SHORT, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR IF SUCH ENVIRONMENTS ARE INHABITED EVENLY WITH PANMICTIC CONDITIONS OR IF LIMITED CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MARINE POPULATIONS, EVEN ON SMALL GEOGRAPHIC SCALES, LEADS TO GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN AREAS WITHIN THE ARCHIPELAGO OR EVEN SINGLE REEF STRUCTURES. TO STUDY DIVERSITY PATTERNS AND CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN REEFS OF THE SPERMONDE ARCHIPELAGO, INDONESIA, POPULATION GENETIC ANALYSES OF TWO REEF ORGANISMS WERE PERFORMED BY USING THE MITOCHONDRIAL CONTROL REGION AND MICROSATELLITE MARKERS. A VERTEBRATE (CLOWN ANEMONEFISH) AND AN INVERTEBRATE SPECIES (SEA SQUIRT) WERE STUDIED IN PARALLEL TO INVESTIGATE IF THERE ARE GENERAL PATTERNS OF CONNECTIVITY IN SPERMONDE FOR SESSILE OR SITE ATTACHED MARINE SPECIES, WHICH CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED TO A LARGER GROUP. THE GENETIC POPULATION STRUCTURES REVEALED RESTRICTIONS IN GENE FLOW IN THE CLOWN ANEMONE FISH (AMPHIPRION OCELLARIS), ESPECIALLY BETWEEN NEAR-SHORE REEFS IN THE SOUTH OF THE ARCHIPELAGO. THIS INDICATES VERY LOCALIZED GENETIC EXCHANGE AND MAY ALSO REFLECT THE HIGH SELF-RECRUITMENT TYPICAL FOR THESE FISH. THE NORTHERN REEFS SHOW HIGHER CONNECTIVITY DESPITE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES BEING LARGER. THE FILTER-FEEDING SESSILE SEA SQUIRT, POLYCARPA AURATA, FEATURES SIMILAR POPULATION PATTERNS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN AREA. HOWEVER, CONNECTIVITY IS GENERALLY HIGHER IN THE MIDDLE AND SHELF EDGE AREAS OF SPERMONDE FOR THIS SPECIES.

THE LACK OF MORPHOMETRIC DATA LIMITED THE CONSIDERATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE AND HEALTH STATUS OF THE POPULATIONS, FUNDAMENTAL TO IDENTIFY THE MOST VULNERABLE SITES AND THE CORRECT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. FOR THIS REASON, A ROV DATASET, CONSISTING OF 624 DIVES CARRIED OUT BETWEEN 40 M AND 1825 M IN THE LIGURIAN SEA, TYRRHENIAN SEA, AND SICILY CHANNEL, WAS ANALYSED TO EXTRAPOLATE QUANTITATIVE DATA TO DESCRIBE THE POPULATIONS.

A NEW METHOD IS DESCRIBED FOR ASSESSING CORAL RECRUITMENT, WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE IMPROVED STUDY OF RECRUITMENT PATTERNS ON DEEP REEFS GLOBALLY, AS THE METHOD DOES NOT REQUIRE SCUBA DIVING. THIS METHOD ALLOWS FOR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER STUDIES AS THERE APPEARS TO BE NO INFLUENCE ON THE DENSITY, COMPOSITION, OR SETTLEMENT ORIENTATION OF RECRUITS RELATIVE TO THE MOST COMMONLY USED METHODS. USING THIS METHOD, WE INVESTIGATED CORAL RECRUITMENT AT NINGALOO REEF, WESTERN AUSTRALIA, FINDING THE ABUNDANCE OF CORAL RECRUITS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH DEPTH AND WAS HIGHEST AT 25 M. THE SIZE OF CORAL RECRUITS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH DEPTH, WITH LARGER RECRUITS OBSERVED IN SHALLOWER AREAS (3 AND 8 M) THAN IN DEEP AREAS. DISTINCT CHANGES IN SETTLEMENT DENSITIES ON TILE SURFACES OCCURRED WITH INCREASING DEPTH, WITH A SHIFT TO UPPER TILE SURFACES BETWEEN 8 AND 25 M, WHERE THE PROPORTION OF RECRUITS INCREASED FROM 10.72 TO 87.69\%, RESPECTIVELY. OVERALL COUNTS OF RECRUITS WERE LOW, WITH MINIMAL RECRUITMENT AT THE DEEPEST SITES AND MODERATE BUT SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN RECRUIT NUMBERS AND HARD CORAL COVER WERE OBSERVED.

METHODS WE DETERMINED THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE MAJOR BENTHIC TAXONOMIC GROUPS: CORALS, MACROALGAE AND SPONGES, USING A NUMBER OF MODELLING TECHNIQUES AND AN ENSEMBLE USING THE `SDM' R PACKAGE. A RANGE OF GRID SIZES WERE USED (10, 50, 100 AND 250 M) TO IDENTIFY HOW MODEL PREDICTIONS WERE ALTERED. MODELS WERE EVALUATED USING THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE OF A RECEIVER OPERATOR CHARACTERISTIC PLOT (AUC) AND THE TRUE SKILL STATISTIC (TSS) USING A SPATIALLY INDEPENDENT DATASET. RESULTS GRID SIZE HAD A LARGE EFFECT ON MODEL PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE TAXONOMIC GROUPS. MODEL OUTPUTS WERE COMPARED TO NULL SURFACES AND 88.8\% OF MODELS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN NULL. DISTRIBUTION OF CORALS WAS BEST PREDICTED USING THE FINEST GRID SIZE (10 M) REGARDLESS OF MODELLING METHOD, ALTHOUGH A MODEL ENSEMBLE PRODUCED THE BEST RESULTS (AUC = 0.80, TSS = 0.52). MACROALGAE AND SPONGES WERE BETTER PREDICTED AT COASTER GRIDS SIZES (250 M). AGAIN, ENSEMBLES PERFORMED WELL FOR BOTH MACROALGAE (AUC = 0.83, TSS = 0.63) AND SPONGES (AUC = 0.88, TSS = 0.66).

THE ACM HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTORS (NORTHERN, CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN) ACCORDING TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CARBONATE PRODUCERS AND THE REEFS, INFLUENCED BY THE AMAZON RIVER PLUME. HERE, WE CHARACTERIZE THESE STRUCTURES THAT WERE SAMPLED WITH A MANNED SUBMERSIBLE AND MULTIBEAM SURVEYS TO DEPTHS OF UP TO 230 M, EXPLORING THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AMAZON RIVER PLUME AND CHANGING SEA LEVEL FOLLOWING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM (LGM). THE SHELF-SLOPE TRANSITION AND A DEEPER SHELF BREAK IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE BRAZILIAN PORTION OF THE ACM CARRY A SERIES OF PROMINENT HIGH-RELIEF STRUCTURES (HRS) THAT EXPERIENCE A STRONG FLUVIAL INFLUENCE. THE TOPS OF THESE FEATURES ARE BETWEEN 110 AND 165 M DEPTHS AND SEEM TO HAVE ORIGINATED DURING LOWSTANDS, THROUGH EROSION OF PLEISTOCENE SANDSTONES. SILICICLASTIC AND CARBONATE DEPOSITS ACCUMULATED ON THE TOPS OF THESE FEATURES IN SHALLOW WATERS DURING THE LGM AND EARLY DEGLACIATION AND WERE GRADUALLY SUBMERGED BY RISING SEA LEVEL AND SUBSIDENCE. A THIN LAYER OF ENCRUSTING ORGANISMS, CORALLINE ALGAE, SPONGES, BRYOZOANS AND SERPULIDS PRESENTLY COLONIZES MOST OF THESE SURFACES AT THE SITES SAMPLED AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE AGGREGATION OF THIN FINE-GRAINED SILICICLASTIC DEPOSITS. THE CENTRAL SECTOR, OFF THE RIVER MOUTH, IS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION AND LACKS A SHELF BREAK. NEVERTHELESS, LIVING BENTHIC COMMUNITIES OCCUR ON ROCK OUTCROPS.

SUBTIDAL VELOCITIES FROM THE THREE SITES WERE DECOMPOSED INTO REAL-VECTOR, CONCATENATED EMPIRICAL ORTHOGONAL FUNCTIONS (EOFS). RESULTS FROM EOFS INDICATED THAT MODE 1, WHICH EXPLAINED 63\% OF THE SUBTIDAL VARIANCE, WAS ROUGHLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION AT EACH OF THE THREE SITES.

IT HAS SPREAD RAPIDLY ACROSS THE ISLAND OF OAHU, DECREASING THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE BENTHOS FROM SHORELINES TO SIMILAR TO 90 M DEPTH. WE EMPLOYED A BOOSTED REGRESSION TREE MODELING FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY HIGHLY VULNERABLE REGIONS PRONE TO INVASION. OUR MODEL INDICATED THAT REGIONS EXPOSED TO MINIMAL BOTTOM CURRENTS AND AT LEAST FIVE DEGREE HEATING WEEKS ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO A. AMADELPHA COLONIZATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXTRAPOLATED OUR MODEL TO THE MAIN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS AND FORECASTED HOW A 25\% INCREASE IN STATEWIDE ANNUAL MAXIMUM DEGREE HEATING WEEKS MAY CHANGE HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR A. AMADELPHA. ACROSS ALL ISLANDS, WE IDENTIFIED PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE ``HOTSPOT'' REGIONS OF CONCERN FOR RESOURCE MANAGERS AND CONSERVATIONISTS.

OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE CORAL REEFS OF THE GOA HAVE RELATIVELY LOWER LEVELS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION COMPARED TO REEFS IN OTHER REGIONS.

RESULTS SHOW THAT A TRANSITION FROM TERRIGENOUS TO CARBONATE SEDIMENTS CAN OCCUR LATERALLY OR ALONG-SHELF, I.E., TERRIGENOUS AND CARBONATE SEDIMENTS COEXIST ALONG THE SAME WATER DEPTH RANGE. IN NARROW MIXED CONTINENTAL SHELVES, A STRONG LATERAL/LATITUDINAL CHANGE IN THE SEDIMENTARY DOMAINS CAN BE OBSERVED DUE TO LATERAL VARIATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS, SUCH AS SEDIMENT INPUT AND CARBONATE PRODUCTION. WIDER CONTINENTAL SHELVES TEND TO DISPLAY A GREATER MIXING TRANSITION ZONE ACROSS THE DEPTH GRADIENT. THE COEXISTENCE OF REEF BEDS WITH TERRIGENOUS-DERIVED SEDIMENTATION IS THE PRODUCT OF DIFFERENT TEMPORAL SCALES OF GEOLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES.

RESULTS SHOW THE PRESENCE OF TWO CLUSTERS OF SUBMERGED REEFS (14-23 M AND 24-35 M DEEP), ASSOCIATED WITH LONGITUDINAL AND TRANSVERSE BEDFORMS, BANKS, AND SHELF-INCISED VALLEYS. RHODOLITH BEDS COMPRISE THE MAIN INTER-REEF BENTHIC HABITAT. DISTINCT REEF CLUSTERS DEFINED BY REEF TOP DEPTHS INDICATE THAT REEF DROWNING OCCURRED IN TWO DIFFERENT MOMENTS. THE SHALLOWER REEFS ARE LIKELY RELATED TO THE RAPID SEA-LEVEL RISE ASSOCIATED WITH MWP 1C, WHILE DEEPER REEFS ARE INTERPRETED AS REMANENT CARBONATE BUILD-UPS.

THE LONG-TERM EXPLOITATION DYNAMICS OF THIS SPECIES MAKE IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TODAY TO INCREASE PROTECTION AND RESTORATION EFFORTS AS IT PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THIS BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN AREAS WHERE NATURAL RECOVERY IS HINDERED OR UNLIKELY. SO FAR, ONLY VERY FEW EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE PAST, INVESTIGATING SUITABLE TECHNIQUES FOR THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSPLANTATION OF THIS SPECIES. FOR THIS REASON, A REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO SYNTHESIZE PREVIOUS RESULTS AND IDENTIFY THE MOST PROMISING METHODOLOGIES. ADDITIONALLY, SIX DIFFERENT TRANSPLANTATION TECHNIQUES WERE TESTED AND DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REVIEW. FIVE TECHNIQUES USED FRAGMENTS FOR TRANSPLANTATION, WHILE ONE USED NEWLY SETTLED LARVAE ON PVC-TILES. SHALLOW C. RUBRUM COLONIES OFTEN GROW UPSIDE DOWN UNDER CREVICES AND RIMS AS WELL AS IN CAVES, MAKING THE TRANSPLANTATION OF FRAGMENTS COMPARATIVELY CHALLENGING. HERE, C. RUBRUM WAS TRANSPLANTED UPSIDE DOWN UNDER CREVICES USING A PVC-GRID IN COMBINATION WITH EPOXY PUTTY TO HOLD FRAGMENTS IN PLACE, AND THE RESULTS INDICATED THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS TECHNIQUE. IN A NOVEL APPROACH, SHALLOW COLONIES, AND LARVAE ON SETTLING PLATES WERE ALSO TRANSFERRED TO DEEPER AREAS, SUGGESTING THAT MESOPHOTIC POPULATIONS CAN BE RESTORED TO RECONSTRUCT PRE-EXPLOITATION CONDITIONS. ATTACHING THE COLONIES TO THE ROOF OF CREVICES PROVIDED A LEVEL OF SURVIVORSHIP CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTIONAL ERECT TRANSPLANTATIONS OF COLONIES ON ROCK BOTTOM BUT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING MORE REMOVED FROM SEDIMENTATION AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE. FUTURE WORK MUST DEVELOP PERMANENT GRID-MOUNTING METHODS FOR USE IN THE CREVICES BEFORE THIS APPROACH CAN BE FURTHER EXPLORED FOR LARGE-SCALE RESTORATION EFFORTS.

The coral is widely dis- tributed and occurs on all the offshore banks of the north-east Atlantic, with some records from the deepest water of the Minches and Sea of the Hebrides. It is compara- tively rare on the upper continental slope and shelf edge to the west and north of Scotland, and appears to be less common there than previous workers have suggested. It is fairly common in discrete patches on the flanks of Rockall Bank where it occurs at depths between 130 and 400 m (most records are from 220-350 m). The shallowest records are mostly from the southern part of the Bank.
Detection of coral on echo-sounder records of the shelf edge, continental slope and Rockall Bank is difficult, particularly in areas of irregular topography, as colonies are generally only 1-1.5 m in height. Echo-sounder records from the deep water in the Sea of the Hebrides show features up to 18 m in height thought to be related to coral banks. Under suitable conditions groups of colonies can be detected on sonographs (side-scan sonar records).",10.1017/S0025315400046245,WILSON JB_1979_J MAR BIOL ASSOC U K,,,,,,,

HOWEVER, THE SESSILE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES ATTACHED TO THESE REEFS ARE VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOCAL HUMAN IMPACTS DUE TO THEIR LIMITED CAPACITY TO RAPIDLY AVOID UNFAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENTS. IN SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA, HIGH LATITUDE ROCKY REEFS FACE INCREASING THREATS FROM RAPID WARMING, SURPASSING THE GLOBAL AVERAGE. EXISTING MANAGEMENT EFFORTS FOR THESE REEFS RELY HEAVILY ON RESEARCH FROM TROPICAL CORAL ECOSYSTEMS AND SHALLOW TEMPERATE ALGAL-DOMINATED ROCKY REEFS, WHERE SUFFICIENT DATA ALLOWS FOR RELIABLE PREDICTIONS ON THE FUTURE STATE OF THE SYSTEMS. RECENT EVIDENCE FROM SEABED MAPPING PROGRAMS INDICATES THAT MESOPHOTIC REEFS (SIMILAR TO 30-150 M DEPTH) ARE EQUALLY OR MORE EXTENSIVE THAN SHALLOW SYSTEMS IN TEMPERATE WATERS. THEY PROVIDE NOVEL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND COULD POTENTIALLY ACT AS CLIMATE REFUGES FOR SOME COMPONENTS OF SHALLOW WATER COMMUNITIES THAT EXTEND ACROSS DEPTH STRATA. HOWEVER, DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE THREATS FACED BY NON-ALGAL SESSILE ORGANISMS IN EITHER SHALLOW WATER OR MESOPHOTIC SYSTEMS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING TEMPERATE AUSTRALIA. THIS REVIEW EXAMINED THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE DIRECT IMPACT OF PHYSICAL DISTURBANCES, SUCH AS EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, OCEAN WARMING AND DESTRUCTIVE FISHING PRACTICES, ON SESSILE MESOPHOTIC COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL. WE THEN USED THIS TO INFER THE LIKELY DRIVERS OF CHANGE IN TEMPERATE MESOPHOTIC SYSTEMS. WE FOUND THAT AUSTRALIA'S TEMPERATE MESOPHOTIC ECOSYSTEMS WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY FISHING, ANCHORING AND LOST FISHING GEARS COMPARED TO THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE DUE TO LOWER POPULATION DENSITY.

AN EXTENSIVE SUBMERGED FOSSIL REEF OCCURS ON THE SHELF AROUND LORD HOWE ISLAND. MAPPING OF THE SHELF SURROUNDING BALLS PYRAMID, 24 KM SOUTH OF LORD HOWE ISLAND, HAS REVEALED A COMPARABLE SUBMERGED MESOPHOTIC REEF SYSTEM IN 30-50 M WATER DEPTH SUPPORTING SCATTERED LIVE CORAL COLONIES. RADIOCARBON DATING OF CORAL EXTRACTED FROM LIMESTONE CORES ON THE FOSSIL REEF REVEALS THAT ACCRETION OCCURRED DURING THE EARLY HOLOCENE (10,100-8800 CAL. YEARS BP), CONCURRENT WITH THE FIRST PHASE OF HOLOCENE ACCRETION AROUND LORD HOWE ISLAND. THE TIMING OF FOSSIL CORAL GROWTH ON THE SHELVES OF THE TWO ISLANDS INDICATES THAT THE REEFS HAVE BEEN DROWNED BY RISING SEA LEVEL. THE FOSSIL REEF AROUND BALLS PYRAMID IS A GIVE-UP REEF THAT WAS UNABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH SEA LEVEL. AFTER ITS DEMISE, CARBONATE SEDIMENT PRODUCTION CONTINUED ACROSS THE SHELF WITH SANDS AND GRAVELS THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED IN BASINS AND CHANNELS, BETWEEN THE SUBMERGED FOSSIL REEF STRUCTURES. VIBROCORES RECORD A FINING UPWARD SEQUENCE OF SANDS OVERLYING RHODOLITHS AND ANGULAR CARBONATE GRAVELS. THE CORAL REEF AROUND LORD HOWE ISLAND PERSISTED A LITTLE LONGER (-7000 CAL.

RESULTS SHOW THAT FOUR FORAMINIFERAL ASSEMBLAGES (A, B, C AND D) ARE DELINEATED BY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES (Q-MODE CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND NON-METRIC MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SCALING: NMDS), AND THESE ASSEMBLAGES CORRESPOND TO A BACK-REEF TO REEF MARGIN ZONE (0-10 M DEEP; ASSEMBLAGE A), AN UPPER PHOTIC ZONE (10-30 M DEEP) ASSOCIATED WITH HARD SUBSTRATES (ASSEMBLAGE B), AN INTERMEDIATE TO LOWER PHOTIC ZONE (30-90 M DEEP) CHARACTERIZED BY SOFT SUBSTRATES (ASSEMBLAGE C), AND A LOWER PHOTIC ZONE (90-130 M DEEP) ONLY FOUND IN MODERN SHELF SLOPES (ASSEMBLAGE D).

THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM BEGAN WHEN GLOBAL MEAN SEA LEVEL (GMSL) ABRUPTLY DROPPED BY ABOUT 40 METRES AROUND 31,000 YEARS AGO(4) AND WAS FOLLOWED BY ABOUT 10,000 YEARS OF RAPID DEGLACIATION INTO THE HOLOCENE(1).

OUR FINDINGS ARE BASED ON RECOVERED AND RADIOMETRICALLY DATED FOSSIL CORALS AND CORALLINE ALGAE ASSEMBLAGES, AND REPRESENT RELATIVE SEA LEVEL AT THE GREAT BARRIER REEF, RATHER THAN GMSL.

THE DETAILED STRUCTURE OF OUR RECORD IS ROBUST BECAUSE THE GREAT BARRIER REEF IS REMOTE FROM FORMER ICE SHEETS AND TECTONIC ACTIVITY. RELATIVE SEA LEVEL CAN BE INFLUENCED BY EARTH'S RESPONSE TO REGIONAL CHANGES IN ICE AND WATER LOADINGS AND MAY DIFFER GREATLY FROM GMSL.

RECENT CORALLITH-FORMING SCLERACTINIAN CORALS MOSTLY INHABIT THE SHALLOWEST REEF ENVIRONMENTS, BUT CORALLITHS CAN ALSO DEVELOP AT GREATER DEPTHS IN AREAS OF LOW TOPOGRAPHIC RELIEF, UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSTRATUM, LOW CORAL COVER AND HIGH WATER MOVEMENT. HERE, WE REPORT ON DEVONIAN (GIVETIAN FAVOSITES GOLDFUSSI AND FRASNIAN ALVEOLITES? TENUISSIMUS) CORALLA FROM THE HOLY CROSS MOUNTAINS, POLAND. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THESE COLONIES ARE CORALLITHS, ALTHOUGH LESS MATURE THAN USUALLY REPORTED. THESE CORALS, UNLIKE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED GROWTH FORMS OF THIS KIND, LIVED IN RELATIVELY DEEP ENVIRONMENTS: PROBABLY THE UPPER MESOPHOTIC (GIVETIAN, MIOSZW), OR DEEP REEF FORE-SLOPE (FRASNIAN, JAWICA AND KOWALA).

ZAWADA DG,2010,GEOPHYS RES LETT,TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY AND ROUGHNESS OF A TROPICAL BENTHIC SEASCAPE,NA,"TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL PROPERTY OF BENTHIC MARINE ECOSYSTEMS THAT EXISTS ACROSS ALL SCALES AND AFFECTS A MULTITUDE OF PROCESSES. CORAL REEFS ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE, FOR WHICH THIS COMPLEXITY HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPACT WATER FLOW, SPECIES DIVERSITY, NUTRIENT UPTAKE, AND WAVE-ENERGY DISSIPATION, AMONG OTHER PROPERTIES. DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE, ONLY LIMITED ASSESSMENTS ARE AVAILABLE REGARDING THE DISTRIBUTION OR RANGE OF TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY WITHIN OR BETWEEN BENTHIC COMMUNITIES. HERE, WE SHOW SUBSTANTIAL VARIABILITY IN TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY OVER THE ENTIRE INNER-SHELF SEASCAPE OF A TROPICAL ISLAND. ROUGHNESS, ESTIMATED IN TERMS OF FRACTAL DIMENSION, SERVED AS A PROXY FOR TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY, AND WAS COMPUTED FOR LINEAR TRANSECTS (D-T), AS WELL AS THE BENTHIC SURFACE (D-S). SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN BOTH D-T AND D-S WAS CORRELATED WITH THE KNOWN DISTRIBUTION OF BENTHIC COVER TYPES IN THE SEASCAPE. TRANSECT ROUGHNESS VALUES RANGED FROM 1.0 TO 1.7, WITH FEATURES ALONG THE SHELF EDGE BEING MARKEDLY ANISOTROPIC WITH AN ALONG-SHORE BIAS, WHEREAS REGIONS WITH HIGH SCLERACTINIAN CORAL COVER WERE NEARLY ISOTROPIC AND EXHIBITED MINIMAL DIRECTIONAL BIAS. SURFACE-ROUGHNESS VALUES RANGED FROM 2.0 IN PREDOMINANTLY HARDBOTTOM AREAS WITH LOW CORAL COVER TO 2.5 IN AREAS WITH HIGH CORAL COVER. QUANTIFYING ROUGHNESS ACROSS THE SUBSTRATES AND BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES FOR AN ENTIRE SEASCAPE PROVIDES A SYNOPTIC VIEW OF ITS SPATIAL VARIABILITY AT SCALES APPROPRIATE FOR NUMEROUS RESEARCH EFFORTS, INCLUDING ECOSYSTEM STUDIES, PARAMETERIZING HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS, AND DESIGNING MONITORING PROGRAMS.

ZEA S,1993,CARIBB J SCI,"COVER OF SPONGES AND OTHER SESSILE ORGANISMS IN ROCKY AND CORAL REEF HABITATS OF SANTA MARTA, COLOMBIAN CARIBBEAN SEA",NA,"IN THIS AREA CORAL GROWTH IS LIMITED BY A SEASONAL UPWELLING-OUTWELLING REGIME. ABOUT 60% OF THE HARD SUBSTRATUM WAS COVERED WITH A CARPET OF CRUSTOSE, FILAMENTOUS AND THALLOUS ALGAE; THE REMAINDER WAS DIVIDED AMONG SPONGES, SCLERACTINIAN CORALS AND OTHER ANNUALS. ON THE SHALLOW ROCKY SHORE, DIFFERENCES IN AMBIENT ILLUMINATION AND TRAPPED SEDIMENTS BROUGHT ABOUT BY SUBSTRATUM INCLINATION, ARE THE MAIN FACTORS INFLUENCING THE GREATER COVER OF ALGAE ON OPEN (HORIZONTAL TO INCLINED) SUBSTRATA AND THE GREATER OCCURRENCE OF THE SPONGES AND CORALS ON CRYPTIC (VERTICAL TO OVERHANGING) SUBSTRATA. LOWER PREDATION, LOWER ILLUMINATION, AND DECREASED TURBULENCE MAY ACCCOUNT FOR THE GREATER NUMBER OF SPONGE SPECIES, INDIVIDUALS AND AREA COVERAGE FOUND BENEATH DENSE STANDS OF RAMOSE GORGONIANS ON HORIZONTAL ROCKY SHORE SUBSTRATA. COMPETITION FOR SPACE AMONG PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS, NUTRITIONAL STATUS, TURBULENCE, AND SUBSTRATUM TYPE MAY INFLUENCE THE SHIFT IN PREDOMINANCE WITH DEPTH FROM ALAGAE IN THE SHALLOW, OPEN ROCKY SHORE, TO CORALS IN THE MID-DEPTH FRINGING REEF TERRACE AND SLOPE, AND TO SPONGES IN THE DEEP REEF BASE.

HERE, THE MECHANISMS OF CORAL HOLOBIONT PHOTOACCLIMATIZATION OVER A 60 M DEPTH GRADIENT IN THE CENTRAL RED SEA WERE EXAMINED FOR THE FOUR CORAL GENERA PORITES, LEPTOSERIS, PACHYSERIS, AND PODABACIA. GENERAL ACCLIMATIZATION STRATEGIES WERE COMMON TO ALL HOST-SYMBIONT COMBINATIONS, E.G., SYMBIODINIUM CELL DENSITIES AND PHOTOPROTECTIVE (PP) TO LIGHT-HARVESTING PIGMENT RATIOS BOTH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED WITH WATER DEPTH. PORITES HARBORED SYMBIODINIUM TYPE C15 OVER THE WHOLE 60 M DEPTH RANGE, WHILE PACHYSERIS AND PODABACIA HAD LIMITED VERTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND HOSTED MAINLY SYMBIODINIUM TYPE C1. SYMBIODINIUM TYPE C15 HAD GENERALLY HIGHER XANTHOPHYLL DE-EPOXIDATION RATES AND LOWER MAXIMUM QUANTUM YIELDS THAN C1, AND ALSO EXHIBITED A STRONG PHOTOACCLIMATORY SIGNAL OVER DEPTH THAT RELATES TO THE LARGE DISTRIBUTION RANGE OF PORITES. INTERESTINGLY, THE CORAL HOST HAD AN EFFECT ON SYMBIODINIUM PIGMENT COMPOSITION. WHEN COMPARING SYMBIODINIUM TYPE C1 IN PODABACIA AND PACHYSERIS, THE BETA-CAROTENE CHL A(-1), THE PERIDININ CHL A(-1), AND DIADINOXANTHIN CHL A(-1 )RATIOS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN HOST SPECIES. OUR DATA SUPPORT A VIEW THAT DEPTH ACCLIMATIZATION OF CORALS IN THE MESOPHOTICS IS FACILITATED BY SYMBIODINIUM PHYSIOLOGY, WHICH IN TURN IS HOST-SPECIFIC.",10.3389/fmars.2015.00004,ZIEGLER M_2015_FRONT MAR SCI,,,,,,,
